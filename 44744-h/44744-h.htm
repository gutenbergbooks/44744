<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The history of medicine is closely interlinked
with the development of theology. The errors
of one are for the most part reflected in the mistakes
of the other. No matter how obscure and
dark the origin of either, whether derived from
ignorance and superstition or not, the ultimate
achievement alone must be taken into consideration.
We do not reject chemistry because it
originated in alchemy, we do not disregard astronomy
because its roots are entwined with the
teachings of astrology, and so in theology and
medicine we look to the final issue. The statements
set forth in this book should not be construed
as reflecting the development of theology
or medicine at the time, but as the belief of the
people existing in these periods. Philosophy
may have been pure, but if the mind of man was
faulty the responsibility must not be laid at the
door of science. It is the function of the historian
truthfully to depict the thought and spirit
of the time of which he writes. This has been
attempted in the present work. It is not a criticism
of a system, but a criticism of man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
There can be no doubt that absurd superstitions
are still existent for which the twentieth century
will be severely criticized in time to come.
Thus the words of our martyred President may
well be used as a motto for this book: “With
malice towards none, with charity for all.”</p>

<p>The last chapter of this book has been added
by the translator, as it seemed necessary for the
full discussion of the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<p class="st1">WHAT IS MEDICAL SUPERSTITION?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> and superstition are twin brothers.
Altho the former leads humanity to its sublimest
ideals and the latter only presents us with a
caricature of human knowledge, both are children
of the same family. Both originate in a
sense of the inadequacy of human science in
regard to natural phenomena. The fact that the
most important processes of organic life can not
be traced to their ultimate origin, but that their
investigation will soon lead to a point of irresistible
opposition to further analysis, has always
called forth a feeling of impotency and dependence
in the human mind. This consciousness of
being dependent upon factors which are entirely
beyond human understanding has thus given
rise to the metaphysical need of reflecting upon
these mysterious factors, and bringing them within
reach of human comprehension. Humanity,
in attempting to satisfy such a metaphysical
requirement from an ethical standpoint, created
faith, which subsequently found expression in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the various forms of religion. It is not within
the scope of this essay to consider how far Divine
revelations have been vouchsafed on this subject.
Superstition undoubtedly entered the
scene when, simultaneously with these, endeavors
were made to consider and to explain physical
processes from the standpoint of such metaphysical
requirements. It is true that this did
not, at first, lead to a marked contrast between
faith and superstition; for a period existed in
which faith and superstition—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the metaphysical
consideration of ethical values and the
metaphysical consideration of the entire phenomena
of life—were not only equivalent, but even
merged into one conception. This occurred in
an age in which mankind considered all terrestrial
processes, whether they were of a psychical
or of a material nature, as immediately caused
by the steady interference of supernatural powers—a
period during which the deity was held
responsible for all terrestrial phenomena. During
this period faith became superstition, and
superstition, faith. A separation did not take
place until some especially enlightened minds
began to evolve the idea that it would be more
reasonable to explain natural phenomena—temporal
becoming, being, and passing away—by
natural rather than by supernatural causes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
The reaction against this better interpretation,
the tenacious adherence to the original association
of terrestrial manifestations with metaphysical
factors, created the superstition of the
natural sciences. The birth of superstition in
the Greek world must be placed about the seventh
century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, the period during which Thales
of Miletus came forward with his endeavor to
explain natural processes in a natural manner.
This attempt of the Milesian is the initiation of
a rational scientific conception of natural manifestations,
and the ancient theistic consideration
of nature became superstition only in opposition
to such a view. It follows, then, that what holds
good with regard to the interpretation of natural
manifestations in general holds good in medicine
especially. Here, also, superstition came into
question only when, besides the original theistic
conception of the functions of the body and besides
the metaphysical treatment of the sick, a
valuation of the normal as well as of the morbid
phenomena of the human organism came into
vogue which took into account terrestrial causes.
Not until this stage was reached did theism and
theurgy lose their title and become superstition;
until then they could claim fullest acceptance in
medicine as thoroughly logical consequences of
the prevailing theory of life. This took place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
so far as Greek medicine was concerned, at about
the end of the sixth century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span> The Corpus
Hippocraticum already shows us Greek medicine
as being purified from all theistic sophistications
and only reckoning with natural causes.
When this separation must have taken place for
pre-Greek, Indian, Assyrian, and Egyptian culture
can not be at present determined with certainty.
For the Egyptian and Babylonico-Assyrian
manuscripts, so far known, show an
intimate admixture of true observation of nature
with theistic speculations—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, a treatment
of medicine which, altho it took account of
physico-natural manifestations, was still deeply
tinctured with superstition.</p>

<p>According to what we have stated, medical
superstition might be defined as follows: “Belief
that the normal as well as the pathological
manifestations of organic life may be explained
and eventually treated, without consideration
of their physical nature, by means of supernatural
agencies.”</p>

<p>Medical superstition varies according to the
kind and the origin of these supernatural causes,
and therefore appears in the greatest variety
of forms. If these causes were looked for in
celestial regions, medical superstition became
vested with the religious garb, and its source was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in the religious cult; but if the belief prevailed
that God shared the domination of the world
with other mysterious elements, such as were
embodied in different forms in accordance with
the various philosophical systems, medical superstition
bore a philosophical and mystical
stamp whose origin is revealed in the history of
philosophy. But if certain mysterious powers
hidden in the womb of nature or active above
the earth were considered to influence human
life, medical superstition assumed a physical
character. However, it frequently followed that
the above three factors acted simultaneously or
in varying combinations, or certain other elements
which were inherent in human nature
cooperated. For this reason it is sometimes not
quite easy to decide as to the source from which
this or that form of medical superstition principally
derived its persistent currency. But, nevertheless,
it is our intention to divide our subject
in accordance with the sources from which the
several forms of medical superstition spring, as
it is absolutely impossible to obtain a satisfactory
view of the extensive material without first
attempting a systematic arrangement of the data
at hand.</p>

<p>But before attempting to inquire why the
purest and most valuable fountains of all human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
knowledge—religion, philosophy, and natural
science—have at the same time become sources
of medical superstition, it will be advisable to
explain the character which medical science
had assumed under the exclusive domination of
theism, and how conditions shaped themselves
when physico-mechanical philosophy appeared
and began to do battle with the theistic conception
of life. These conditions played such a
special part in the development of medico-physical
superstition that it becomes necessary first
to examine their power and tendency before attempting
to contemplate medical superstition
proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p class="st2">THEISM IN ITS RELATION TO MEDICINE AND
IN ITS STRUGGLE WITH THE PHYSICO-MECHANICAL
THEORY OF LIFE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">As we</span> explained in Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, the development
of all peoples has passed through a period
during which medico-physical knowledge found
expression exclusively in the teachings of religion.
By theism we mean the system which endeavors
to explain natural phenomena by supernatural
causes. However, this view of nature,
with its tinge of religion, did not as yet show
any trace of superstition. It was rather the only
justifiable conception of nature and thoroughly
in keeping with the power of comprehension of
man, until it began to dawn upon the mind that
natural phenomena might be due to natural
causes. This was the period of which we stated,
in the beginning of this investigation, that faith
became superstition and superstition became
faith. It was during this time that the powers
above were held accountable for all bodily ailments
of mankind. It was their task most carefully
to observe the functional processes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
human body in all its phases, and to protect
their undisturbed continuance. But as the inhabitants
of heaven, like the inhabitants of the
earth, were subject to whims, it happened very
often, unfortunately, that they attended to their
task of protecting the undisturbed development
of the vegetative as well as the animal functions
of the body in a very unsatisfactory manner,
sometimes, in fact, even purposely neglecting it.
Thus disturbances occurred in the regular course
of organic life, and this brought diseases into the
world. If, therefore, the gods were directly
responsible for the appearance of disease, it was
palpably their duty to effect its elimination.
Thus it came about that pathology and therapy
were exclusively attended to by the gods. But
in what light they regarded these medical duties
of theirs, and how they performed them, were
matters subject to very varying considerations,
as expounded by the different religions of antiquity.
The Babylonian considered the great
god Marduk the expeller of all maladies, whereas
Urugal, Namtor, and Nergal were recognized
gods of pestilence.</p>

<p>Similar ideas prevailed among the Egyptians.
The cat-headed goddess Bubastis was believed
to deal out to mothers the blessings of fertility.
Ibis showed an especial interest in those human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
beings who were troubled with disturbances of
digestion, and this interest found benevolent
expression in the invention of the clyster.</p>

<p>With the Greeks also the gods rendered services
to diseased humanity. Thus Apollo invented
the art of healing, and if his time permitted
he occasionally lent a hand when difficulties
beset the entrance into this world of a
young mortal. But, as a rule, it was the duty
of Aphrodite to attend to such cases, just as, in
fact, she was responsible for everything that referred
to love, no matter whether it was a question
of the esthetic or the pathological part of
that passion. Athene was the specialist in
ophthalmology, and it seems that she did not fare
badly with this occupation. A temple was dedicated
to her by Lycurgus, whom, as it appears,
she healed of a sympathetic affection of the eyes;
and, besides, she won by her ophthalmological
activity various ornamental epithets, such, for
instance, as <span title="ophthalmitis">ὀφθαλμίτις</span>, etc.</p>

<p>It was quite natural, in view of the exclusively
theistic conception which in those times preoccupied
the human mind, that the priests were
the sole possessors of physico-medical knowledge;
and naturally so. For when we consider the
theory of life that prevailed at that period, who
could have been better qualified to give information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to men regarding their own body as well as
regarding nature in general, than the priest, the
mortal representative of immortal gods? And
who better qualified than the priest to invoke the
aid of the heavenly powers in all bodily ailments?
Thus it was the unavoidable consequence
of the theistic theory of life that the
priest was the physician as well as the representative
of physical knowledge and also the helper
and adviser in all mundane exigencies. Whether
bodily or psychic troubles afflicted individuals,
whether an entire population groaned under
heavy chastisements like pestilence, aid and deliverance
were always sought in the sanctuary of
the gods, from the infallible priest. And the
priests were always equal to the occasion; they
have always, in a masterly manner, known the art
of satisfying the medico-physical needs of their
suppliants. For the religions of all civilized peoples—and
Christianity by no means occupies an
exceptional position in this respect—have always
endeavored most strenuously to keep physical as
well as medical thought in strictest dependence
upon their doctrines and dogmas. To attain
this end various ceremonies, customs, and dogmas
were relied upon to keep the priests in a
position to secure the assistance of the gods for
humanity harassed by pain and affliction. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sacred observances were strange, and varied with
the various religious systems. According to the
primeval cult of Zoroaster, all evils, consequently
also all diseases, were derived from the
principle of darkness which was embodied in the
person of Ahriman, and only the sacerdotal caste
of the magicians who sprung from a special
Median tribe was able to heal them. But it was
by no means easy to become a member of this
caste and to acquire the magic powers pertaining
to it alone. It was necessary before gaining
mastery over the powers of nature to become initiated
into the mysteries of Mitra. However,
after priestly consecration had once been bestowed,
the individual thus honored bore the
proud title “Conqueror of Evil,” and was able
to practise medicine. As the most essential constituent
of every medical treatment, the divine
word was applied in the form of mysterious exorcisms,
sacred hymns, and certain words which
were considered specially curative in effect, particularly
the word “Ormuzd,” the name of the
highest god, in whose all-embracing power of
healing great confidence was placed.</p>

<p>The Sumerians, the precursors of Babylonico-Assyrian
culture, ascribed a considerable and
important rôle to dreams. They were considered
to bring direct medical advice from the gods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and it became the office of the sacerdotal physician
to interpret the dream in such a way as to
alleviate the sufferings of the dreamer.</p>

<p>The ancient Greek culture also conceded a
conspicuous medical significance to dreams, and
even arranged a system of its own, that of the
temple sleep, in order always to obtain prophesying
dreams from the gods. The patient, after
the obligatory offering, was required to remain
a night in the temple, and his dream during this
night was the medical advice of the divinity in
its most direct form. But only the priest was
able to interpret a dream obtained in such a
manner, and to extract medical efficacy from it.
But as it occasionally happened that a too prosaic
and phlegmatic patient did not dream at all,
the priest was benevolent enough to intercede.
He was always promptly favored by the gods
with a suggestive dream.</p>

<p>The medical function of the priests had reached
a peculiar development during the first centuries
of Rome. This was manifest especially in the
time of public calamities, such as pestilence,
war, etc. When such events reached dimensions
which threatened the existence of the republic,
attempts were made to gain the favor of
the gods by most curious ceremonies. The celestials
were simply invited to take part in an opulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
banquet. The first divine feast of such a
character was celebrated in Rome in the sixth
century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, on account of a great epidemic.
Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury, and
Neptune were most ceremoniously invited to
take part in a religious banquet which lasted for
eight days. The images of the gods were placed
upon magnificently cushioned couches, and the
tables were loaded with dainties. Not only the
gods, but the entire population, were invited;
every one kept open house, and whoever wished
to do so could feast at the richly prepared boards
of the wealthy. Even the pronounced enemies
of the house were allowed to enter and to enjoy
the dainties without fear of hostile remarks; indeed,
it was deemed advisable in the interests of
public hygiene to unchain the prisoners and to
liberate them. But if the gods, in spite of the
most opulent entertainments, did not have any
consideration, and if pestilence, military disaster,
failure of crops, or whatever was the immediate
cause of popular anxiety, continued to
persist with unabated fury, endeavors were made
by theatrical performances to provide as much
as possible for the amusement of the gods. Such
plays, at first, consisted only in graceful dances,
with flute accompaniments, and from these simple
beginnings, according to Livy, Book 7,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, the drama is said to have developed
all those variations which characterized the
scenic art of antiquity. There can be no doubt
that even the stage of modern times is of religio-sanitary
origin—a peculiar fact which modern
patrons of the theater scarcely ever dream of.</p>

<p>An attempt was eventually made to increase
the delight of the gods in such amusements by a
number of novel devices. For instance, it was
stipulated that the performances instituted to
ward off the invasion of Hannibal were to cost
333,333⅓ copper asses. But if, nevertheless, the
gods were not sufficiently propitiated by banquets,
dances, and playing of the flute, and if they
could not be prevailed upon by such pastimes to
remove the pestilence or other calamity, a dictator
was named who, if possible, on September
13th, drove a nail into the temple of Jupiter to
appease divine indignation. It appears that
this was a primeval custom of the Etruscans; at
least, it is reported by the Roman author, Cincius,
that such nails could be seen in the temple
of the Etruscan goddess Nortia. This nail therapy
was resorted to by the Romans, for instance,
during the terrible plague which raged in the
fifth century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, and of which the celebrated
Furius Camillus died.</p>

<p>Wonderful as all the described procedures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
seem to us, and closely as they may conform to
the modern conception of superstition, at the
time they originated they were considered as
quite removed from that superstition with which
we so closely identify them to-day. For the
period which saw the above events was an era of
exclusive theism, and for that reason divine
sleep, divine feasts, the sacred performances, and
all the other peculiar means which were employed
to secure medical aid of the gods, were
well-established features of religious worship.
The stigma of superstition was not set upon them
as yet. And this state of things naturally persisted
so long as the theistic theory of life stood
unchallenged.</p>

<p>This absolute reign of theistic theory dominating
human life through the above-described
therapeutic ideas was followed by an epoch in
which theism was forced to divide its authority
with a powerful rival—namely, the physico-mechanical
theory of life. The struggle between
both these systems was ushered in, for the Hellenic
as well as for the Occidental world of civilization,
by the appearance of Ionian philosophy.
Even in our own day this struggle is still going
on in many minds. This much, at least, is
certain: that superstition has always been
especially active in medicine in areas of civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
where the theistic idea has gained the
ascendency.</p>

<p>The deadly struggle between theistic and
physico-mechanical theories of life in the realm
of medicine has found no place in the experience
of Hellenic and Roman antiquity. The change in
opinion was rather wrought by a gradual recession
from the idea that the gods interfered with
the proper course of man’s bodily functions.
This conviction resulted from a progressive
growth of his physico-mechanical knowledge,
and became established at least as far as the
thoughts and the opinions of the physicians were
concerned. That the other classes, in particular
the representatives of religion, did not so peaceably
acquiesce in this mechanical conception of
life we shall soon explain in Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="3">III.</abbr> It was
different, however, with the art of healing itself.
Even the Corpus Hippocraticum reveals to us
a medicine which had been purified from all
theistic admixtures, and from the publication
of this work (<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, from about the fifth century,
<span class="f8">B.C.</span>, up to the overthrow of the ancient period—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
until about the fifth or sixth century, <span class="f8">A.D.</span>)
no further attempt to refer the cause of disease
and the treatment of disease to the gods of the
ancient heavens is noticed in medical works.
On the contrary, that great efforts were made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
look for the nature of disease in the mechanical
conditions of the body is proven by a number of
the most various medical doctrines. The extensive
work of Galen, that antique canon of medicine,
which dates back to the second century,
<span class="f8">A.D.</span>, disavows all theism and all theurgy, and
relies solely upon physico-mechanical methods:
observation, experiment, dissection. Antique
religion and antique medicine had effected a
reconciliation—a reconciliation, however, in
which neither party was to acknowledge a complete
defeat; but the result was an amicable settlement,
in which their just dues were given both
to the theistic and to the physico-mechanical
theories of life. The point of agreement upon
which this settlement, or, to express it better,
compromise, was made was teleology.</p>

<p>By teleology we understand the conception
that all earthly existence is created by a supreme
power in accordance with a preconceived plan,
and that, accordingly, all organic life, in form
and action, is most perfectly adapted to the task
prescribed for it by this power. This conception
was absolutely indispensable to antique
medicine; for it allowed the adherents of the
theistic theory without hesitation to consider
man as a product of the creator, which was distinguished
in all directions and which bore witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the wisdom of God, a position which precluded
the assumption, which was impossible
according to the antecedent medical observations,
that disease came from God. For it
seemed quite plausible, according to the physico-mechanical
theory of life, that disease might be
a product of a number of adverse, purely earthly
conditions, an assumption not involving the
slightest doubt of the wisdom and creative power
of the gods. This teleological doctrine, which
runs like a red thread through all ancient philosophy,
becomes conspicuously prominent in
Galen. Every section of the powerful work of
Galen—anatomy, as well as physiology, pathology,
and therapy—bear witness to the most confident
teleological conception, a conception which
in the end culminates in the verdict (“Use of the
Parts,” Book 11, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="14">XIV.</abbr>): “The creator
of nature has disclosed his benevolence by wise
care for all his creatures, in that he has bestowed
upon each one what is truly of service to it.”</p>

<p>This teleological idea of all earthly becoming,
being, and passing away was henceforth destined
to be a permanent factor in human speculation.
Christianity received it as a possession from
antique civilization, and only the philosophy and
natural science of modern times have been able
to threaten its permanence. Biology, as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
modern creation, teaches us that all natural
phenomena owe their existence to natural causes,
that the natural world is subject to natural laws.
And, accordingly, teleology, as we encounter it
in the works of the heathen Galen and in the
writings of the Christian Church Fathers, has
turned out to be superstition, which, however,
must by no means be classed with the vagaries
of mere medico-physical superstition. In coming
to this decision, however, we must beware of rash
generalization. In this connection we refer only
to that kind of teleology which dominated the
world previous to the teachings of Descartes and
Spinoza, and previous to the advent of modern
natural science, with its biological methods.
Whether, after all, a theory of life might be possible
which, while avoiding the reproach of superstition,
might be traced to teleological prepossessions,
is a question we can not here discuss.
It is admittedly true that the deeper we penetrate
into the secrets of nature the more energetically
the existence of a marvelous, intelligent
will manifests itself as permeating all domains
of nature. However, if this fact is not denied on
principle, as modern materialism denies it, and
proper allowance is made for it, a rehabilitation
of teleology as a necessary factor of our theory
of life would be the logical consequence. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
course, this teleology would bear a stamp entirely
different from that of antiquity and of the middle
ages, which is recognized to be superstition. It
should not pretend to include the consideration
of the entire organic world, but confine its conclusions
to the last links in the chain of experience
and argument which science has forged
from natural phenomena. Now this could be
accomplished, in our opinion, even without apprehension
of interfering with the indispensable
requirements of modern naturalists: “The terrestrial
world in its forms and processes is governed
solely by terrestrial laws.” What the
appearance of such a teleology should be is expressed
by William Hartpole Lecky in the following:</p>

<p>“This conception, which exhibits the universe
rather as an organism than a mechanism, and
regards the complexities and adaptations it displays
rather as the results of gradual development
from within than of an interference from
without, is so novel, and at first sight so startling,
that many are now shrinking from it in alarm,
under the impression that it destroys the argument
from design, and almost amounts to the
negation of a Supreme Intelligence. But there
can, I think, be little doubt that such fears are,
for the most part, unfounded. That matter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
governed by mind, that the contrivances and
elaborations of the universe are the products of
intelligence, are propositions which are quite
unshaken, whether we regard these contrivances
as the result of a single momentary exercise of
will, or of a slow, consistent, and regulated evolution.
The proofs of a pervading and developing
intelligence, and the proofs of a coordinating and
combining intelligence, are both untouched, nor
can any conceivable progress of science in this
direction destroy them. If the famous suggestion,
that all animal and vegetable life results
from a single vital germ, and that all the different
animals and plants now existent were developed
by a natural process of evolution from that
germ, were a demonstrated truth, we should still
be able to point to the evidence of intelligence
displayed in the measured and progressive development,
in those exquisite forms so different
from what blind chance could produce, and in
the manifest adaptation of surrounding circumstances
to the living creature, and of the living
creature to surrounding circumstances. The
argument from design would indeed be changed;
it would require to be stated in a new form, but
it would be fully as cogent as before. Indeed, it
is, perhaps, not too much to say that the more
fully this conception of universal evolution is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
grasped, the more firmly a scientific doctrine of
Providence will be established, and the stronger
will be the presumption of a future progress.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In such a manner, despite the fact that in teleology
the point of agreement between theistic
and physico-mechanical medical thought has
been now found, theism, in the course of the history
of our science, continually attempted new
attacks upon the physical tendency in medicine;
and with each assault superstition in medicine,
as well as in the natural sciences, was most palpably
exposed.</p>

<p>After having satisfied ourselves in this second
chapter regarding theism and its attitude with
reference to the physico-mechanical theory of
life, we shall now enter upon the consideration
of the various forms of medical superstition, and
it is our intention, as stated in the first chapter,
so to arrange the enormous material at hand as
to discuss medical superstition according to the
sources from which it has sprung. We shall
begin by pointing out the intimate relations
which have prevailed between the teachings of
religion and superstition.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p class="st1">RELIGION THE SUPPORT OF MEDICAL
SUPERSTITION</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Religion</span> undoubtedly plays the most conspicuous
part in the history of medical superstition.
Religious teaching, of whatever character,
has fostered medical superstition more
than any other factor of civilization. Not only
has religion called forth and nourished medical
superstition, but it has also defended it with all
the influence at its disposal. Indeed, it has not
infrequently happened that those who were reluctant
to believe in the blessings of a medical
theory ridiculously perverted by religion were
exposed to persecution by fire and sword. And
this not only from one or other religious denomination,
for all religious believers, without
exception, had proved to be the most assiduous
promotors of medical superstition; so that we
are probably not wrong in designating priesthoods
in general, whatever their creed, as the
most prominent embodiment of medical superstition
during certain periods of the world’s history.
But the details will be learned from the
following paragraphs:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 1. <b>Priesthood the Support of Medical
Superstition.</b>—The principal reason for a not
quite reputable activity in the chosen representative
of a deity is probably the fact that, with the
appearance of a physico-mechanical contemplation
of the world, the theistic theory of life,
which until then had exclusive sway, was forced
into a pitched battle with a newly formulated
definition of nature. This struggle was carried
on principally by the priesthood, who, as a
matter of fact, had most to lose from the ascendency
of a new theory of life which only reckoned
with natural factors. They indeed had
been the means, until then, of procuring for the
people the assistance of the gods in all bodily
ailments, as they had been the exclusive depositories
of physical knowledge. And it could
scarcely be expected that the priesthood would
at once willingly relinquish the extensive supremacy
hitherto exercised by it as the oracle
of divine guidance in all medico-physical questions;
for humanity has always considered the
possession of authority much more delightful
than submission, and the ruler has always objected
most energetically to any attempt which
disputes his rule. This was precisely what was
done by priests of all creeds when the mechanico-physical
theory of life began to supersede the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
obsolete dreams of theistic medicine. Fair-minded
persons will surely allow that such action
was natural. But they can not approve of the
methods resorted to, unless they belong to those
who feel bound always to discern nothing but
what is sacred in every action of a servant of
heaven.</p>

<p>In order to wage war most effectively against
the physico-mechanical theory of life, the priesthood
at once claimed for themselves the power of
completely controlling nature. They made the
people believe that the celestials had bestowed
upon them the faculty of dominating nature in
the interests of the sick, and that all powers
of the universe, the obvious ones as well as those
mysteriously hidden in the depths of nature,
were obedient to sacerdotal suggestions. The
servant of heaven professed that he could regulate
the eternal processes of matter, with its becoming,
being, and passing away, quite as irresistibly
as his eye was able to survey the course
of time in the past, present, and future.</p>

<p>Equipped with these extensive powers, a
priest necessarily appeared to the people not
only as physician, but also as a miraculous being
crowned with the halo of the supernatural. And
this was the rôle he actually played in many
ancient religions. With the peoples of Italy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
priest appeared—at a period, indeed, which was
previous to the beginning of Rome—as physician,
prophet, interpreter of dreams, raiser of
tempests, etc. He held exactly the same offices
among the Celtic tribes in Gaul and Britain.
His position was the same in the Oriental world,
and by the Medians and the Persians especially
were priests considered to be persons endowed
with supernatural powers. We may notice that
members of a certain Median tribe formed the
sacerdotal caste, and bore the name of “Magi.”
However, this name, which originally was confined
to the priestly order, obtained, in the course
of time, a distinctly secular meaning. Very soon
many cunning fellows arrived at the conclusion
that the trade of a sacerdotal physician and conjurer
might bring a profitable livelihood to its
professor, even if this professor were not a priest
but a layman. Thus there arose a special profession
of sorcerers, miracle workers, and medicine-men,
who protested with solemn emphasis
that they were able to cure all physical as well
as psychical ailments of their fellow men as
thoroughly as the priests had done. But in
order to bestow the required consecration upon
this art, these gentlemen usurped the venerable
name of the above-mentioned Median sacerdotal
caste and called themselves “Magi.” Thus it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
happened that the name “Magus” (magician),
which originally served to designate a distinct
sacerdotal caste, deteriorated into a designation
of charlatans and swindlers. This could never
have occurred unless the priests had prostituted
their sublime profession and degraded it to various
kinds of discreditable medico-physical
deceptions. This alone is why priesthood is
responsible for the rise of the magicians, of these
worthless fakirs. But if Pliny (Book 30, Chapter
<abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, § 2) attempts to rank magic as an offshoot
of medicine, he is justified in doing so only in so
far as the priest, during the theistic period, was
also the physician, as is well known. Only from
this point of view is it possible to trace a genetic
relation between medicine and magic. But medicine
in itself has not taken the slightest part in
the promotion of magic and the success of its
unsavory reputation. Indeed, our science has
suffered too much through the practise of magic
to burden itself with the paternity of this disreputable
child of civilization.</p>

<p>It appears that the name of the Celtic priests
(“druids”) had become subject to the same abuse
as the name of the Median priests of sacerdotal
caste. Thus we learn of female fortune-tellers
of the third century, <span class="f8">A.D.</span>, who call themselves
“druidesses.” But it seems that this application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the word “druid” has remained a local one and
strictly limited, whereas the expression “magician,”
quite generally employed, became, in the
course of time, the designation of charlatans
and medical impostors. For these swindlers, who
carried on medico-physical hocuspocus, and who
claimed to exercise supernatural powers, were
called “magicians” during the entire period of
classic antiquity, and we find the same use of the
word in the middle ages, and sometimes also in
more modern times.</p>

<p>But this profession of magician, which sprang
from priesthood, has largely promoted superstition
in medicine, and was particularly instrumental
in bringing it into extraordinary repute.
It is our intention to concern ourselves a little
more minutely with magicians and magic.</p>

<p>§2. <b>The Spread of the Word “Magic.”</b>—How
and when magic was transplanted from its
Oriental home to the Occident can not be determined
with certainty; for the Greeks, as well as
all antique peoples, probably all nations, had a
belief in ghosts and demons, in fortune-telling,
and in sorcery. But it appears, nevertheless,
that the ancient civilized peoples of the Orient,
and particularly the Persians, cultivated the
magic arts with especial devotion, and it is more
than probable that it was from the East that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
prevailing cult of magic had been imported into
the West. Pliny, for one, tells us (Book 30,
Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, § 8) that magic was brought to
Europe by a certain Osthanes, who accompanied
King Xerxes on his military expedition against
Greece. This man Osthanes, as Pliny reports
further, is said to have disseminated the seeds of
this supernatural art (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velut semina artis portentosæ
insparsit</i>) wherever he went, and with such
success that the Hellenic peoples were actually
mad after it, and prominent men traveled
through parts of the Orient, there to acquire
personally and thoroughly these magic arts, thus,
as was the case with Pythagoras, Empedocles,
Democritus, and Plato. In fact, it is said of
Democritus that he opened the tomb of a celebrated
magician—Dardanus of Phœnicia—that
he might restore to publicity the mysterious writings
of the latter. It appears, moreover, that
Alexander the Great entertained an implicit belief
in magic—at least, Pliny reports that during
his wars he was always accompanied by a celebrated
magician.</p>

<p>Magic arts were likewise in favor among the
Romans. Even Nero attempted to master the
secrets of magic, altho unsuccessfully (Pliny,
Book 30, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, § 5). A particular impetus
was given to magic toward the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
last century before Christ and during the first
century of the Christian era, when the rise of
many fantastic philosophical systems greatly
promoted and supported the belief in the supernatural
powers of magic. Subsequently, in the
middle ages, magic experienced an accepted and
systematic development. These conditions, however,
will be more explicitly referred to later on.</p>

<p>The treatment of the sick through supernatural
agencies assumed quite astonishing dimensions
under the Roman emperors. The belief in
magicians was so generally disseminated that
even the emperors themselves and the imperial
authorities were almost completely devoted to it.
Thus, for instance, the emperor Hadrian (117-138,
<span class="f8">A.D.</span>) caused himself to be treated by physicians
who claimed miraculous powers, and he is
said to have written a book on theurgy. In
fact, Suidas (62 Julianus) reports that Hadrian,
on account of a severe outbreak of pestilence in
Rome, sent for the son of the Chaldean, Julian,
who, simply by the power of his miracles,
arrested the progress of the disease. Under
Antoninus Pius official proclamations were made
in the forum, directing the attention of the people
to the importance of magicians (Philostratus,
43), and the emperor Marcus Aurelius even relates
that, when in Caieta, the gods in a dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
prescribed a remedy for the hemorrhagic cough
and vertigo from which he was suffering
(“Marcus Aurelius,” Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, § 17, page 11).</p>

<p>But it appears that the magicians finally went
too far with their tricks, and endangered human
life by their treatment; so that several emperors
decided upon adopting more rigorous measures
against their knaveries. The emperor Septimius
Severus (193-211), altho himself originally
devoted to magic, prohibited, when on a visit in
Egypt, all books which taught curious arts
(Aelius Spartianus, “Hadrianus,” Chapter
<abbr class="ni" title="15">XV.</abbr>, § 5, page 146). Later the emperor Diocletian
took energetic steps toward abating the
mischief done by magical treatment of the sick,
and the magicians were permitted to carry on
such arts only so far as would not be detrimental
to the health of the people. However, this order
did not check the magicians any more than it
benefited those who were still tortured and
brought to the point of death by magic quackery.
Neither did medical science derive any advantage
whatever from this well-meant but completely
abortive effort of the emperor, for the
magic physicians persisted in carrying on their
hocuspocus, and unconcernedly debased the
pharmacopœia by the introduction of nonsensical
and loathsome substances. Let us examine more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in detail this department of medical practise
among the magicians.</p>

<p>§ 3. <b>The Medical Practise of the Magicians.</b>—The
magicians adopted various modes of
procedure in the treatment of the sick: they
either attempted, as do our modern quacks, to
create the impression, by administering medicine,
that they were actually able to direct the
treatment of the ailing in a rational manner, or
they restricted themselves to various kinds of
magical observances.</p>

<p>The drug therapy of the magicians actually
utilized everything under the sun as a remedy.
The more out of the way and the less suitable for
a remedy a substance seemed to be, the more likely
it was to be chosen by the magician intent upon
healing. For it was always the main object of
these practising quacks to make their treatment
as sensational as possible. In this they succeeded
best by employing the most extraordinary
substances as remedies. Thus they made use of
gold, silver, precious stones and pearls, just because
these, owing to their value, were held in
great esteem, and their medical application,
therefore, was bound to create a sensation. But
the most loathsome substances were quite as
readily employed, for here, too, the most general
attention was bound to be attracted by their application.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Human feces, urine, and menstrual
blood were introduced into the materia medica
in such a manner. The awe with which parts
of corpses usually inspired the non-medical part
of the public was relied upon by the magicians
to advertise their cures. Thus these quacks
administered powders of human bones to the
ailing.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as what is conspicuous and unusual
has always enjoyed an especial esteem with
humanity, the incredible remedies of the magicians
naturally found everywhere an abundance
of believers; and as particularly the most nonsensical
theory is most tenacious of life, provided
it has been presented in apparent combination
with the miraculous, the medical armamentarium
rapidly took on a very peculiar aspect.
Until the present more modern times medicine
was condemned to the encumbrance of this rubbish,
this list of odd and loathsome remedies,
whose admission to the pharmacopœia was only
due to the whim of a human mind that constantly
hankers after the extraordinary and the miraculous.</p>

<p>Finally the magic observances to which the
magicians resorted in the treatment of the sick,
have shown a remarkable vitality, for they are
in vogue even in modern times, and many sections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of our people even to-day swear unconditionally
by the curative efficacy of various agencies
which demonstratively have been derived
from the medicine of the magicians. But now
such agencies are no longer ascribed to magic or
sorcery, but they are called “cures by means of
sympathy.” And as many modern people believe
that various incomprehensible mystic performances
cause certain mysterious powers,
otherwise absolutely unknown, to exert a curative
influence upon certain diseases, so did the
ancients believe exactly the same. This was the
origin of exorcism as a remedy for disease. Exorcism
played a conspicuous part in the middle
ages as a means of stopping hemorrhages, and
even in these modern times, as is well-known,
this method of cure finds many adherents.</p>

<p>This magic treatment was believed to be especially
efficacious if the exorcisms had been written
or engraved upon paper, gold, precious stones,
etc., in which case they were suspended around
the neck of the patient. Countless talismans
(from the Arabic <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">tilsam</i>, magic image) and amulets
(from the Arabic <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">hamalet</i>, trinket) were thus
manufactured, and even to our own time there
are survivals of this medical superstition. Altho
these mystic observances are performed in various
ways, and their modifications are practically innumerable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
yet certain radical resemblances are
continually appearing among the magic rites of
the most diverse races, and some of these practises
have even persisted up to the present time.
Thus the rope of the hung criminal plays a conspicuous
part in antique magic as well as in
modern sympathy treatment; the same importance
is attributed to shooting-stars, to the moon,
to crossroads, to certain numerals, such as 3, 7,
9, etc. It is a highly interesting fact that such
conceptions, as remarkable for their therapeutical
associations as for their crass superstition, are
possessed of a vitality which persists for centuries.
Peoples, religions, philosophical systems,
political revolutions have risen and vanished,
but the belief in the curative action of the rope
of a hung criminal or the therapeutic significance
of the crossroad has survived. The mystic
influence which is exerted by the numerals 3,
7, 9, and still more so by the dreadful 13, upon
the life and health of man, haunts the minds of
the multitude in this century of physical enlightenment
exactly as it did in remote antiquity. But
we can not here enter into the reason for these
interesting facts, and we must refer those who
desire more detailed information on this subject
to the voluminous literature of superstition.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the belief in magic cures was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not more prevalent among the ancient professors
of medicine than among the laity, and even the
most prominent practitioners were not able to
emancipate themselves from this belief. Galen,
for instance, who, as is well-known, mastered
the entire literature of antique medicine as none
before or after him has ever done, openly avows
his belief in the efficacy of magic cures, and,
what is more remarkable, Galen in this respect
has changed from a Saul to a Paul. He ruefully
recalled, later, the condemnatory decree which
he had originally promulgated regarding the
magic treatment of the sick. Let us call to mind
how he expresses himself in his essay on medical
treatment in Homer: “Many, as I have done
for a long time, believe that conjurations resemble
the fairy tales of old women. But gradually,
and from the observation of obvious facts, I have
come to the conclusion that power is exercised
by them; for I have learned to know their advantages
in stings of scorpions, and also in bones
which became lodged in the throat, and which
were at once coughed up as a result of conjuration.
Many remedies are excellent in every respect,
and magic formulæ answer their purpose”
(“Alexander of Tralles,” Book 11, Chapter
<abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 477). One of the most
prominent post-Galenian physicians also, Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Tralles, openly avows, with reference
to this utterance of Galen, that he himself is a
believer in magic cures, and he says: “If the
great Galen, as well as many other physicians of
ancient times, bear witness to this fact (the efficacy
of magic treatment of the sick), why shall
we not impart to you what we have learned from
our own experience and what we have heard
from trustworthy friends?” (“Alexander of
Tralles,” <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="ibidem">ibid.</abbr>). Accordingly, his <span title="Biblia Iatrika">Βιβλία Ἰατρικά</span>
was filled with enumerations of the most various
magical cures. But, now, if the classics of antique
medicine have proven themselves to be so
friendly to the medical science of magicians,
what was the condition of the mind, then, of
the average physician of ancient times? Is it
astonishing if young and old, high and low, without
distinction, were blind adherents of magical
medicine? Thus medical literature of the last
century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, and especially that of the centuries
from the Christian era until late in the middle
ages, was an actual treasury of conjuration
and other mummeries. This description applies
specifically to the “Materia Medica” of Quintus
Serenus Samonicus, written in hexameters. It
is true, the magical sequel to this book entailed
painful consequences on the writer, for the emperor
Caracalla had the poor author executed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(Ael. Spartian., “Caracalla,” Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="4">IV.</abbr>,
§ 4) merely, as it is reported, because he dared
to advise in his works as a remedy against intermittent
fever the wearing of amulets, a medical
expedient which had been prohibited by the
emperor himself.</p>

<p>The work of Sextus Placitus Papyriensis, who
lived in the fourth century, which treats of remedies
derived from the animal kingdom, teems
with magic nonsense.</p>

<p>But an actually inexhaustible stock of medical
conjurations was contained in the work of a layman,
Marcellus Empiricus. This gentleman, who
had been foreign minister under the emperors
Theodosius the first and the second, had written
a thick folio volume on medicaments. This literary
performance, which, according to our ideas,
appears to be very odd for a minister of state,
was by no means remarkable in the fifth century,
for the study of medical subjects was, so to say,
fashionable among the laity of that period; in
fact, even prelates and bishops did not think it
beneath their dignity to busy themselves with
various medical questions and to write medico-physical
books. Thus the laurels of medical renown
haunted our good Marcellus and would not
let him sleep, so that he abridged his hours of
official duty to such an extent that he was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to compile a Materia Medica of thirty-six apparently
never-ending chapters. But if the statesmanship
of Marcellus was on a par with his
medical book-making, the two Theodosii could
not have missed the time their cabinet minister
stole from them, for his medical scribbling is an
utterly worthless compilation. Not only did
Marcellus copy from medical authors of the most
discordant opinion, but he particularly busied
himself in collecting indiscriminately all the
magical nonsense of the ancient times; in fact,
it seems that he was very eager to obtain all this
magical rigmarole direct from the mouth of the
people, for he says that he collected his remedies
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab agrestibus et plebeiis</i>.” Accordingly his book
is as worthless and insipid to the physician as it
is valuable to the historian, especially the historian
of civilization. Here are a few examples
of this medicine of the magicians:</p>

<p><i>Remedy against warts and corns</i> (Pliny, Book 28,
Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="4">IV.</abbr>, § 12, page 268): “Lie on your back
along a boundary line on the twentieth day of the
moon, and extend the hands over the head. With
whatever thing you grasp when so doing, rub the
warts, and they will disappear immediately.”</p>

<p>“Whoever, when he sees a shooting-star, soon
afterward pours a little vinegar upon the hinge
of a door, is sure to be rid of his corns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remedy against headache</i> (Pliny, <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="ibidem">ibid.</abbr>): “Tie
the rope of a hung criminal around the forehead.”</p>

<p><i>Remedy against bellyache</i> (Priscian, physician
of the fourth century, Book 1, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="14">XIV.</abbr>,
and Sprengel, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 248): “If any one
suffer from colicky pains he may sit down on a
chair and say to himself: ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per te diacholon, diacholon,
diacholon</i>.’”</p>

<p>“A person who has an attack of colic may
take the feces of a wolf, which, if possible, should
contain small particles of bone, enclose them in
a small tube, and wear this amulet on the right
arm, thigh, or hip.”—<cite>Alexander of Tralles</cite>, Book
8, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 374.</p>

<p>“Take the heart from the living lark and wear
it as an amulet at the left thigh.”—<cite>Alexander of
Tralles, ibid.</cite></p>

<p><i>Remedy against epilepsy</i> (advised by the physician,
Moschion Diorthotes. “Alexander of
Tralles,” Book 1, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="15">XV.</abbr>, page 570):
“The forehead of an ass is tied to the skin of
the patient and worn.”</p>

<p>“Gather iris, peonies, and nightshade when
the moon is on the wane, pack them into linen
and wear as an amulet.” Advised by the magician
Osthanes.—<cite>Alexander of Tralles</cite>, Book 1,
Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="15">XV.</abbr>, page 566.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take a nail from a cross and suspend it from
an arm of the patient.” Given by a physician
of the second century, <span class="f8">A.D.</span>, by the name of
Archigenes.—<cite>Alexander of Tralles</cite>, Book 1, Chapter
<abbr class="ni" title="15">XV.</abbr>, page 566.</p>

<p>“Wear on the finger a jasper of bluish-gray
luster.”—Advised by <cite>Dioscorides</cite>, Book 5, 159.</p>

<p><i>Remedy against podagra</i> [gout] (“Alexander of
Tralles,” Book 12, page 582): “Take a gold leaf
and write upon it when the moon is on the wane:
mei, threu, mor, for, teux, za, zon, the, lu, chri,
ge, ze, on. As the sun becomes firm in this
name and daily renews itself, so does this formation
also make firm as conditions were previously.
Quickly, quickly, rapidly, rapidly. For behold!
I call the great name in which becomes firm
again what was destined to die: Jas, azyf, zyon,
threux, dain, chook. Make this formation firm
as it has been, quickly, quickly, rapidly, rapidly.
This document must be covered with the tendon
of a crane, enclosed in a capsule, and worn by
the patient at his heel.”</p>

<p><i>Remedy against diseases of the eye</i> (advised by
Sextus Placitus Papyriensis. Magnus, “Ophthalmology
of the Ancients,” page 597): “If the
right eye becomes afflicted with glaucoma, rub it
with the right eye of the wolf, and, similarly, the
left eye with the left eye of the wolf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>In photophobia (fear of light) “Wear as an
amulet an eye which was taken from a live
crab.”—<cite>Quintus Serenus Samonicus.</cite> Magnus,

<p>With pains of the eye the patient must, with
a copper needle, put out the eyes of a green lizard
caught on a Jupiter day, during a moon

The eyes must be worn in a golden capsule, as
an amulet around the neck (<cite>Marcellus Empiricus</cite>.
Magnus, “Ophthalmology of the Ancients,”
page 602.)</p>

<p>The above illustrations are surely sufficient to
give the reader an idea of the medicine of the
magicians. At the same time they show the
great similarity which exists between these ancient
magic cures and the sympathetic cures of
our people at the present day.</p>

<p>§ 4. <b>Ancient Medicine and Magic.</b>—But
how is it possible that the ancient physicians,
and even the most enlightened minds among
them, should not only have tolerated such a
crass medical superstition as the above examples
have shown us, but should even have
incorporated them in their works? Incomprehensible,
however, as this fact may appear
to the modern practitioner, it becomes conceivable
if the condition of antique medicine and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the medical profession of ancient times is considered.</p>

<p>In the first place, ancient medical science
adopted an entirely different mode of diagnostico-theoretical
method than that employed by
professors of medicine in modern times. Ancient
natural science (compare also Chapter <a href="#V"><abbr class="ni" title="5">V.</abbr></a> of this
work), as well as ancient medicine, obtained
their scientific views exclusively by deduction—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
they deduced individual results from general
presumptions, or, rather, they construed, by
reason of some general presumption, the physico-medical
consequences which were to follow from
such a general supposition. If this attempt to
obtain an insight into physical processes is extremely
hazardous, it becomes still more precarious
when the manner and means in which
these general presumptions were arrived at
were primarily of an entirely hypothetical
nature. It is true, no fundamental objection
can be raised to this method, as even modern
natural science and medicine, despite the fact
that their methods of investigation in a diagnostico-theoretical
respect scarcely admit of material
objections, can not do without hypothesis.
But hypothesis is not always mere hypothesis.
It is well known that there are hypotheses
which, even in the minds of the most conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
investigators, are not inferior to that
knowledge which is obtained by experiment and
observation, whereas other hypotheses again
present the distinct stamp of insufficiency and
makeshift. The trustworthiness and the heuristic
value of an hypothesis depend upon the
quality of the diagnostico-theoretical process by
means of which it was obtained. If this process
has been such as physical investigation is bound
to insist upon, the hypothesis thus arrived at is
fully justified to supply the still absent data with
regard to the phenomena in question. This,
however, can be accomplished by hypothesis
only when the latter is not set forth until it
plainly appears that, in spite of a conscientious
and orderly arrangement of observation after
observation, of experiment upon experiment,
without the admission of logical loopholes, full
data in regard to the nature of the phenomena
is not forthcoming. In such a case we may consider
as actually proven by hypothesis what observation
and systematic experiment, continuous
and logical, were intended to prove, and failed.
However, this inductive hypothesis is alone entitled
to be considered in medicine. Naturally,
such an inductive hypothesis was not thought of
by the ancients, as the inductive method of investigation
was generally quite unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
them. The process by which ancient medicine
usually attempted to find its hypothesis was by
an argument from analogy. Each and every
point of resemblance, however superficial, between
two phenomena was considered sufficient
by the ancient naturalists to warrant the assumption
that analogous phenomena in the most
various domains were most certainly proven to
possess similar points of resemblance. And
upon the basis of such an insecure method of
deduction—which, moreover, was selected entirely
at the option of the observer—the ancient investigator
erected the boldest hypotheses. Thus,
for instance, the atomic theory of Leucippus and
Democritus is an hypothesis which rests upon
the basis of a conclusion from analogy. The
motes which appear in the rays of the sun led
these two ancient investigators to the conception
that, like the particles of dust sporting in the
air, the primary component parts of everything
that exists in the entire universe consisted of
similar particles.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It appears that Epicurus arrived at his theory
of light (according to which, as is well known,
images of things were brought to the senses by
delicate but absolutely objective small pictures
which were detached from the surface of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in a continuous current) by the fact that many
animals—for instance, snakes—shed their skins.
The theory of humoral pathology, one of the
most important advances in medical science, was
based on a conclusion from analogy and arrived
at by the deductive method.</p>

<p>The diagnostico-theoretical lines in which
antique medicine moved were bound—and this
is the point of importance in this case—to exert
a determining influence upon medical criticism.
For medico-physical criticism can only appear
in closest connection with the prevailing condition
of the respective sciences, being really
nothing else but a precipitate from them. Thus
the ancient physicians were compelled to take an
entirely different position toward magical medicine
than we moderns, educated in the school of
inductive methods, have always taken. The
probable and similar, the supposable and possible,
in which deductive medicine found its
data, working on the lines of argument from
analogy, were necessarily bound to find expression
also in the character of medical critique,
and it was impossible, therefore, for the ancient
physician to detect anything absurd or contrary
to experience in hypotheses which the practitioner
of to-day at once brands as nonsensical
and superstitious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>We are not in the least justified, therefore,
in speaking disparagingly of Galen and Alexander
of Tralles because they believed in magical
medicine and applied it in their practise.
As no human being can jump out of his skin, so
is he unable to get beyond the intellectual advancement
of his time. As the ancient physicians
were also unable to do this, accordingly
they were believers in the magical medicine.</p>

<p>But there is still a second point which explains
the remarkable position taken by ancient physicians
in relation to magical medicine—namely,
the fact that the conception of miracle and magic
were essentially different in the ancient world
from what they are at present. The belief in
the interference of spirits and supernatural
beings in terrestrial matters, and the manifestations
of their influence exerted in manifold ways—sometimes
for good, sometimes for evil—had been
widely disseminated from the earliest times, and
we encounter them in all periods of classic antiquity.
This belief in demons had become incorporated
in the systems of many leading philosophers
of antiquity. Now if the world were filled with
demons the natural consequence was that their
activity would manifest itself in various ways.
It was necessary, therefore, that man should always
be prepared to experience manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which more or less violated the customary order
of terrestrial happenings, and for this reason
nothing that could be styled a miracle really existed
for him. A miracle could not be conceived
in its full modern sense until it was realized that
the course of all natural phenomena was nothing
but the expression of eternal and changeless
laws. However, it was not until comparatively
late that this conception became generally disseminated;
thus, for instance, it was considered
as self-evident, even in the latest periods of the
middle ages and during the first beginnings of
modern times, that divine influence could always,
and actually did always, cause an alteration
in the course of the functions of the body.
In fact, there is an amazingly large number of
people even in our time who believe this, and
for whom, therefore, the conception of miracles,
especially of miraculous healing, is to-day on
about the same level as that on which it stood
in the time of Galen and Alexander of Tralles.</p>

<p>Thus we must admit that the ancient physicians
were by no means below the standard of
civilization and culture attained during their
period if they believed in the possibility of
extraordinary cures effected by means extraneous
and unscientific in their treatment of the
sick, and, accordingly, they supported such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
methods. However, this belief in miraculous
medicines on the part of the ancient physician
was always restricted to certain limits. It is
true, the conception was always adhered to that
this or that magical agency, or this or that
magical action, might exert an influence upon the
disease; but such a belief never led them to omit
any strictly medical measures of a surgical or
gynecological nature. On the contrary, the intelligent
physicians of antiquity firmly insisted
that the actions of the surgeon and of the gynecologist
were not to be hampered by any metaphysical
considerations; thus, for instance,
Soranus demanded most energetically that the
midwife should be “ἀδεισιδαίμων” (without fear
of any demon)—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, she was not to be superstitious,
but free from any imputation which
would render her curative interposition objectionable.</p>

<p>The profession of the magicians, due to the
persecutions to which they became subject under
the Christian emperors Valens, Valentinian, and
Theodosius, became considerably less prominent
during the predominance of Christianity, but the
ideas upon which it had been erected in ancient
times still survived; in fact, these ideas were
even to a certain extent systematically elaborated
during the middle ages, and at this time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
distinction was made between higher and lower,
or white and black, magic. The white magic
busied itself with good spirits, the black magic
with the bad ones. Magicians, therefore, who
operated by the aid of the devil, and even in
medicine called in the assistance of the devil,
were called “necromancers.” For the first time
magic became amalgamated with certain philosophical
speculations and also with Christian-dogmatic
constituents. The methods adopted by
magic medicine under these conditions are so
peculiar and are so close to the boundary lines
between philosophy and religion that we are
really not quite certain whether to relegate it to
the domain of one or of the other. But as the
fundamental parts of these methods were actually
supplied by philosophy, we propose to defer
this discussion for the present, and to take up
here another form of medical superstition which
was derived exclusively from religion—namely,
“sleep in the temple.”</p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Lucretius, Book 2, Verse 113, <abbr title="the following">sqq.</abbr></p>
</div></div>

<p>§ 5. <b>Sleep in the Temple.</b>—One of the generally
practised methods of medical science during
the period of Hellenic civilization which was
still fully under the influence of theism—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, for
at least two or three centuries before the Hippocratic
era—was what was known as “temple
sleep.” In fact, this method must be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a sign of a faith distinctly deep and sincere, a
faith naive and childlike indeed; but as a sign
of such a faith this method is actually pathetic.
No taint of superstition could be found in it at
the early period referred to. It was still the
pure and unadulterated expression of the generally
prevailing conception that human art is to
no purpose in any case of disease, and aid must be
found with the gods—with those gods who regulate
and personally execute all terrestrial phenomena
down to the minutest details. Temple
sleep was not degraded into superstition until
medicine had come to the conclusion that the
phenomena of disease were not evidence of an
interference by supernatural power in the functions
of the body, but disturbances of the function
of the body caused exclusively by natural causes.
In accordance with this view, which first found
its fullest and clearest exposition in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus
hippocraticum</i>, it would seem absolutely necessary
for temple sleep to lose all recognition from the
art of healing. However, this not being the case,
it was bound to deteriorate into an act of superstitious
mummery, and the principal blame for
this sad decadence is to be laid primarily upon
the priests. It was their duty especially to lead
into the path of truth the patients who persisted
in crowding into the temples in the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
naive and childlike piety. They sealed their
own condemnation as fosterers of superstition
when they failed to do this duty, and endeavored
rather, by every means in their power, to confirm
the multitude in their ancient belief that
the gods were practising medicine. Non-Christian
as well as Christian priests played this rôle
for many centuries with equal ability and equal
perseverance, as will be seen from the following
brief history of temple sleep.</p>

<p>The belief in the efficacy of temple sleep had
already been thoroughly shaken during the time
of the great Hippocrates; therefore, in the sixth
century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, the laughing philosopher of Hellenism,
Aristophanes, the satirical contemporary
of Hippocrates, in Act <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, verses 654 to 750, of
his comedy <span title="Ploutos">Πλοῦτος</span>, severely criticizes the manner
and method in which temple sleep was employed.
Let us listen to the words in which the
poet describes what happened in the temple
during the observance of this rite.</p>

<p>The god Æsculapius, accompanied by his
daughter Panakeia, appears in the temple to examine
in person the patients gathered there.
The first one he meets is a poor wretch, Neokleides,
who, being blear-eyed, expects cure from
the god. The medically skilled Æsculapius
smears upon the inverted lids of this patient a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
salve which causes such pain that the poor fellow
will probably never seek his help again. The
second patient met by the god is the blind god,
<span title="Ploutos">Πλοῦτος</span> (<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, Wealth Personified). Here the
conduct of Æsculapius is entirely different from
that which he adopted when treating poor Neokleides.
Now he carefully strokes the head of the
patient, then produces a linen cloth and carefully
touches the lids with it. He then calls his
daughter Panakeia, who winds a red cloth round
the head of blind Wealth. Now Æsculapius
whistles, and two mighty serpents appear, glide
under the purple cloth, and lick the eyes of the
patient. Shortly afterward the god regains his
sight.</p>

<p>This passage is a cutting satire on practises
which undoubtedly prevailed in the Greek temples
as early as the sixth century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span> But,
nevertheless, it took a long time before the
patients lost their belief in the miraculous efficacy
of temple sleep, and the priesthood continually
strove to revive, by the mysterious stories
of various kinds they recounted to doubters, the
belief in temple sleep. The sixth of the marble
votive tablets which were found in the temple of
Æsculapius at Epidaurus shows the kind of
miraculous reports invented by the priests. The
latter were in the habit of inscribing upon these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
tablets reports of cures that had occurred in their
sanctuary, for the benefit of the visitors of the
temple and for the still greater benefit of the
medical historians; but it is quite probable that
the priesthood, intent upon curing, were encouraged
in their medico-literary attempts only by
the silent hope of creating an abundant supply
of patients by such miraculous reports. The
above tablet, No. 6—which probably dates
from the third century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>—tells us that a
blind man by the name of Hermon, a native of
Thasos, had recovered his sight by sleeping in
the Epidaurean temple of Æsculapius. However,
it appears that this man Hermon had been
a miserable wretch, for he disappeared without
having expressed his thanks in hard cash. Naturally
such ingratitude provoked the god,
and summarily he blinded the thankless individual
again. It required a second temple
sleep before the god condescended to become
helpful once more. But our tablet does
not mention anything about the amount of
the remuneration paid by our friend Hermon
who had been twice cured of blindness; neither
is this at all necessary. The miraculous tablet,
even without stating the price, doubtless made
sufficient impression upon the minds even of the
most parsimonious of future patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Altho, therefore, the more enlightened among
the Greeks recognized, as early as in the sixth
century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, the futility of temple sleep as a
means of healing, the ancient world never relinquished
it entirely. We encounter it again in
the later periods of antiquity. Thus, for instance,
Suetonius and other ancient authors tell
us that two patients, one blind, the other lame,
one day approached the emperor Vespasian,
who happened to be in Alexandria, asking him
to spit into the eyes of the one and to stroke the
paralyzed limbs of the other; for they had been
notified in temple sleep that they would be restored
to health if only the emperor would deign
to perform the above-mentioned manipulations.
But Vespasian was an enlightened ruler who, in
spite of his imperial dignity, did not have much
confidence in the medical qualities of his saliva
and of his hands, and accordingly unceremoniously
dismissed both supplicants. This caused
great terror among the priests of Serapis and
among the courtiers, for obviously they had interpreted
this affair solely as intended <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in majorem
Vespasiani gloriam</i>. The emperor was importuned,
therefore, kindly to aid the unfortunate,
but he persisted in his refusal. Probably he was
right in fearing the loss of his prestige should the
imperial medical powers prove unequal to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
task of curing disease. Not until the priests
solemnly vouched for the truthfulness of the
dream-sending god Serapis, and declared a failure
of the imperial cure to be impossible, did
Vespasian’s stubbornness relent. Now he spat,
and rubbed the paralyzed limbs, and the blind
saw, and the paralytic arose and walked.</p>

<p>§6. <b>Church Sleep.</b>—When, subsequently,
the ancient religions died out, and had left the
world as an heritage to Christianity, temple
sleep had by no means died out also. On the
contrary, after the lapse of three centuries, it
again came into favor with the Christian priests.
And the use of it now was scarcely less in favor
than it had been a thousand years previous in
the world of the ancient Greeks. Let us mention
a few examples. The first four stories are
taken from the works of Gregory of Tours.</p>

<p>Mummolus, who came to the court of Justinian
(527 to 565) as the ambassador of King
Theudebert, suffered greatly from calculi of the
urinary bladder, and during this journey he became
subject to an attack of renal colic. Things
went badly with poor Mummolus, and he was in
a great hurry to make his will. Whereupon he
was advised to pass one night sleeping in <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Andrew’s Church, at Pateras, for <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew had
performed many miraculous cures in this place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
No sooner said than done. Mummolus, greatly
tormented by pain and fever, and despairing of
life, had himself placed upon the stone flags of
the sanctuary, and waited there for the things
that were to happen. Suddenly, toward midnight,
the patient awoke with a violent desire to
urinate, and discharged in a natural manner a
calculus which, as <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gregory assures us, was
so enormous that it fell with a loud clatter into
the vessel. From that hour Mummolus was
hale and hearty, and joyfully started on his
journey homeward.</p>

<p>In Brioude, the capital of the present department
Haute-Loire, there was a woman named
Fedamia, who had been paralyzed for years.
In addition to this, she was penniless, and her
relatives, therefore, brought her to the Church
of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julian, who enjoyed a great reputation in
Brioude, in order that, even if she did not become
cured, she might at least make some money
by begging at the church door. For eighteen
years she had lived thus when, one Sunday
night, while she slept in the colonnade adjoining
the church, a man appeared who took her by
the hand and led her toward the grave of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Julian. On arriving there she uttered a fervent
prayer, and in a moment felt as if a load of
actual chains fell from her limbs. All this, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
is true, happened in a dream, but when the
patient awoke she was hale and hearty, and was
able, to the amazement of the assembled multitude,
to walk, with loud prayers, to the grave of
the saint.</p>

<p>A certain man, deaf, dumb, and blind, known
by the name of Amagildus, also tried the sleep
in the Church of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julian, at Brioude. But it
appears that this saint was not always quite
accessible to the wishes of the sick. It is true,
Amagildus was not obliged, like Fedamia of the
previous narrative, to pass eighteen years in the
basilica, but, nevertheless, he had to sleep for a
full year in the colonnade of the church before
the curative power of the holy martyr delivered
him from his ailment.</p>

<p>Veranus, the slave of one of the clergy under
Gregory, was so violently attacked by gout that
he was absolutely unable to move for an entire
year. Thereupon his master pledged himself to
advance the afflicted slave to the priesthood if
<abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin would be willing to cure him. To
accomplish this cure the slave was carried to
the church, and there placed at the feet of the
saint. The poor wretch had to remain there for
five long days, and it seemed as tho <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin
had forgotten all about him. Finally, on the
sixth day, the patient was visited by a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
seized his foot and drew it out straight. The
slave rose to his feet in terror, and perceived
that he was cured. For many years he served
<abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin as a priest.</p>

<p>But the most wonderful cure was that of the
German emperor Henry <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, called “The Saint”
(1002 to 1024). This emperor, who was of Bavarian
stock, suffered greatly from the stone,
and had retired to the Italian cloister Monte
Cassino, inasmuch as this cloister during that
period justly enjoyed an extraordinary medical
reputation. But whether the monks of Monte
Cassino, altho well versed in medical art, did
not have sufficient confidence in their ability to
treat an emperor, or whether they were induced
by some other reason, is not known; however,
instead of submitting the imperial patient to the
operations of terrestrial medicine, they surrendered
him to the providence of heaven, and
more particularly to the sympathy of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict.
This saint fully justified the confidence
that was placed in him, for, during an acute
period in the patient’s sufferings, he appeared
in his own holy person, and with his own holy
hands he performed the necessary operation, and,
after having pressed the stone that he had removed
from the bladder into the hand of the
sleeping emperor, he retired heavenward. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he took care from his heavenly residence to attend
to the prompt healing of the operation
wound, and this was surely very good of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Benedict. In fact, his entire behavior during
this case was extremely proper and laudable;
for is it not much more fitting that the imperial
bladder should be delivered from its disagreeable
visitor, the stone, at the hands of a saint than
by those of mortal beings, even if those mortal
beings were the pious and medically skilled
monks of Monte Cassino?<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The form in which we encounter the Christian
temple sleep in the above stories is as like as two
peas to that practised in the Hellenic temples.
They are distinguished merely by the fact that
the Greek gods generally hastened to the assistance
of the patients after the latter had spent
one night in the temple, whereas the Christian
saints often allowed years to pass before the patient,
who was crying for aid, secured relief.</p>

<p>Christianity has, however, created one variation
of the temple sleep, and this is the sleep
which is taken, altho outside of the church, at
any place whatever, but with invocation of the
saints. This sleep was said to be exactly as efficacious
as that taken in the church itself, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the patient had fervently prayed before
falling asleep, and had particularly remembered
the saint whose assistance he required. The two
following narratives, which are also taken from
the works of Gregory of Tours, may serve as significant
examples of this variety of temple sleep.</p>

<p>Alpinus, Count of Tours, was so tormented for
years by a pain in his foot that life had no
further joys for him, so that, sleepless and without
appetite, he took to his bed. Again and
again had he, in secret prayer, appealed to <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin for relief. So one day the Count suddenly
falls into a deep sleep, during which <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin appears to him, making the sign of the
cross over the diseased foot. Thereupon the pain
suddenly left him, and Alpinus was able to leave
his couch, fully cured. In this case the saint
showed himself extremely considerate toward
the sick count, in that he was attired in a smart
uniform when paying his visit. It was his intention,
obviously, in choosing this costume to gratify
the martial tastes of the nobleman; for <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin, when visiting patients, by no means
always affected this warlike array, as will be seen
from the following story.</p>

<p>A certain woman was so severely afflicted with
campsis of the fingers that she completely lost
the use of her hands. Even a visit to the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
which was consecrated to <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin in Tours
had brought her no relief. The patient was
obliged to leave the sanctuary with her fingers
still diseased. But it seems that this patient was
actually of a very contented disposition; for when,
upon her return, away from Tours, she lay down
to her first night’s rest, she thanked God that at
least her life was spared, and that she had been
permitted to see the grave of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin. Affected
by so much modesty, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin appeared
to her in her sleep, and, like to <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict in
the case of the emperor Henry, with his own
holy hands he performed somewhat of an operation
upon the patient, in that he stretched her bent
fingers in such a manner that the tense tendons
were evidently torn; for Gregory tells us that,
under the treatment described, blood flowed from
the straightened fingers of the woman. But <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin had entirely discarded his martial attire
upon this visit. Evidently such a garb did not
seem to him appropriate when visiting a female
patient; he therefore appeared before the patient
in a purple cloak with a cross in his hand.</p>

<p>However, the medical activity of the saints
was by no means restricted to cases of church
slumber, but was manifested in the most various
forms.</p>

<p>§ 7. <b>Medical Saints.</b>—Some saints had a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
predilection for medical specialties, and
for that reason paid a particular attention to certain
varieties of disease. Thus, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anna espoused
ophthalmology; <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jude cured coughs; <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Valentine,
epilepsy; <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, the
plague. Not even our domestic animals were
forgotten by the saints. Thus, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roch of Montpellier
distinguished himself especially by his
skill as a veterinarian.</p>

<p>Various were the ways of obtaining the medical
aid of this or that saint. The most simple
was probably that the patient attended mass in
the church of his town, and, at the same time,
made an offering to the saints. More difficult
was it to undertake a pilgrimage to one or the
other of the saints who enjoyed a medical reputation;
this was generally done on the birthday
of the celestial physician. It seems that the
saint was especially inclined on this day to practise
medicine; at least, the chroniclers report
that great numbers of the most difficult cases
were successfully treated on such days.</p>

<p>A very efficacious method of securing medical
treatment from saints was considered to be the
placing of the patient in the church during the
day in the space between the altar and the grave
of the saint. The bed of the mortally sick, fever-racked
patient was placed there, and for days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was compelled to remain here wrestling with
death. This was done, for instance, with the
dying Countess Eborin. In case severe epidemics
were prevalent, it is likely that the churches
very often resembled actual hospitals. Then
dozens of beds with their patients were set up in
the churches, and many a one who was in good
health when he entered the church to say his
prayers probably returned home with the germ
of a pestilence acquired in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>But the saints, as we have seen, were by no
means always so anxious or in such a hurry to
manifest their medical skill. They often made
the patient wait for years for their aid. The
church, therefore, made practical arrangements
to meet every requirement. Larger buildings
were erected close to the church intended for the
reception of patients. Here those who were hoping
to find help could obtain shelter and food,
and were, therefore, able to rest quietly, and to
await the moment when heavenly aid might appear.
This arrangement proved to be extremely
practical, especially because a good many individuals
felt themselves cured only so long as they
remained in the proximity of the saint, but became
reafflicted as before when they returned to
their homes.</p>

<p>But as the slumber and the protracted sojourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in the ecclesiastical hostelries was, nevertheless,
rather uncomfortable, especially in consideration
of the difficulties and dangers which were involved
in traveling during the middle ages, it
was absolutely necessary to invent a means of
administering the medical aid of the saints in
such a way as was always accessible to the
patient. This was managed by the use of relics.</p>

<p>§8. <b>Cult of Relics.</b>—It was believed that
God had endowed the bodies of martyrs who died
for the Christian faith, or of saints distinguished
by extraordinary piety, with a miraculous power
of extraordinary efficacy, and not only the mortal
relics of the martyrs and saints were wonder-working,
but actually all objects which had come
in contact with the persons of saints during their
life as well as after their death. All such objects
were possessed of curative power. Let us
listen to what Gregory of Tours says under this
head: “The miracles which our Lord God
deigned to bring about through <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, his
servant, once a pilgrim in the flesh, he causes
to be repeated daily, to strengthen the confidence
of the faithful; for now he endows his tomb with
precisely the same wonder-working power as was
exhibited by the saint himself while still among
us. Who will now persist in doubting the former
miracles when he observes their continuation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the present day, when he sees the lame walk, the
blind receive their sight, devils cast out, and
every variety of disease cured by the help of
the saint?” (“Bernoulli,” page 287).</p>

<p>The statement of such a luminary of the Church
as Gregory of Tours has undoubtedly gained
ecclestiastical credence for the medical efficacy
not only of the tomb of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, but of all the
relics relating to that saint. It remained only to
distribute the superior medical power which was
contained in the holy tombs and relics in such a
form as would enable all patients, wherever they
happened to be, to make use of them. This task,
apparently most difficult, was settled very easily.
It was discovered that everything which came in
contact with a relic actually absorbed a sacred
and miraculous power contained in the same,
and what had been absorbed was by no means
imponderable. Quite the contrary. Something
of material substance, and, therefore, physically
demonstrable, passed from the relic into the objects
surrounding it. It was indeed a celestial
fluid, but, nevertheless, of so terrestrial a nature
that the priests were able to demonstrate its
transference by means of a common pair of scales.
Thus it was customary that the silk shreds
which were deposited by the pilgrims upon the
tomb of the apostle Peter were weighed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
they were placed there and weighed again after
their removal. This weighing always and without
exception indicated a considerable increase
in their weight. The pilgrim then could travel
homeward and be thoroughly consoled, as the
scale had demonstrated to him the amount of miraculous
power contained in his silk rag. It was
really astonishing, under some circumstances,
what an enormous amount of curative fluid
could flow from such a holy tomb into a single
terrestrial object. This was what happened to a
king of the Suavians. He had a sick son, for
whose cure every remedy had proved unavailing.
He at last sent an embassy to Tours to obtain
a relic of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, but this relic was
destined to be manufactured with the assistance
of the embassy. The priests were quite willing
to comply with the desire of their royal petitioner,
and thus a piece of silk, duly weighed
beforehand, was placed upon the tomb of
<abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin. After this silk had remained for
one night upon the holy sepulchre, and the embassy
had knelt beside praying fervently, the
silk absorbed so much curative power that the
register of the scale was raised to its highest possible
notch.</p>

<p>Knowing, then, that any desired object could
be saturated with the miraculous power contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in a relic, they used to apply this celestial
power through medicaments, and to accomplish
this a number of methods were in use. The most
popular was to scrape the tombstones on the
graves of the saints as thoroughly as possible.
The powder thus obtained was then put into
water or wine, and thus a medicine was acquired
which possessed an astonishing curative power.
It was efficacious even in the severest ailments of
the body. Let us listen to what Gregory of
Tours has reported concerning the medicinal virtues
of such tombstone potions.</p>

<p>He says: “Oh, indescribable mixture, incomparable
elixir, antidote beyond all praise! Celestial
purgative (if I may be permitted to use the
expression), which throws into the shade every
medical prescription, which surpasses in fragrance
every earthly aroma, and is more powerful
than all essences; which purges the body like
the juice of scammony, clears the lungs like hyssop,
and the head like sneezewort; which not
only cures the ailing limbs, but also, and this is
much more valuable, washes off the stains from
the conscience!”</p>

<p>According to this extensive power of the tombstone
powder, it is by no means astonishing that
Gregory of Tours, when traveling, always carried
a box of this miraculous powder with him, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that he was able at once to heal the patients that
surrounded him. I was not able to obtain from
the literary sources at my disposal any data as to
whether the direct licking off of the tombstones
might not have been still more efficacious than
the all-healing extract. Gregory does, however,
report that he was cured of a tumor of the tongue
and lips by merely licking the railing of the tomb
of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin and kissing the curtain of the
temple.</p>

<p>Another very efficacious remedy was the
charred wick of the wax candles which had
burned in the church. This wick was pulverized,
and in this manner a very powerful curative
powder was obtained which, when taken, acted
in a manner similar to that of the watery or vinous
tombstone infusion.</p>

<p>The wax which dripped from candles that were
placed near the holy sepulchre was also credited
with many medicinal virtues, but it seems that it
was employed more as an external than an internal
remedy.</p>

<p>The water which had been used before Easter
to clean the altar of the saints was also considered
to be a famous remedy. If such water was employed
in washing a patient he recovered at once,
and this was the happy experience of Countess
Eborin. This exhalted patient was suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
so severely that she believed her hour had come.
She was then quickly removed to the church of
<abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, and thoroughly washed with the
water that had been used in washing the altar.
And, behold! the disease disappeared, and let
us hope that the overjoyed countess afterward
enjoyed many years of life.</p>

<p>Oil from lamps hung in holy places was also a
favorite remedy, but it appears that it was principally
used for anointing. However, when
mixed with holy water, it furnished a remedy
which could be administered to diseased cattle
with a prospect of positive cure.</p>

<p>Water which was obtained by boiling the covers
in which the relics were wrapped also yielded
a very efficacious medicine. Thus, for instance,
Gregory of Tours caused a silk cover, in which
a piece of the cross of Christ had been wrapped,
to be thoroughly boiled, and he then administered
this decoction to patients; the curtains
which were used as ornaments over holy graves
also displayed an extremely beneficent effect upon
the sick. If an individual suffering from headache
touched, for instance, the carpet which was
placed over the resting-place of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julian, the
pain ceased. But if a patient was afflicted
with abdominal pains, all that was necessary to
relieve him at once was to pull a thread from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this, the above-named carpet, and to apply it to
his rebellious digestive apparatus.</p>

<p>However, it was not necessary for the priests,
under some circumstances, personally to take the
trouble of manufacturing miraculous medicines
from relics. There existed some holy graves
which were so accommodating that they furnished,
of their own accord, the holy material
that was required for the treatment of the sick.
Thus the chronicler records that the grave of the
evangelist John exuded a sort of white manna,
which, owing to its wonder-working curative
power, was distributed all over the world. A
similar product was yielded by the grave of the
Apostle Andrew on the festival day of that saint.
A precious oil scented like nectar also sprang
from the resting-place of this man of God.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that the sacred pharmacopœia
teemed with remedies, and that they were
quite extensively employed is shown sufficiently
by the history of the saints and, above all, by
the works of Gregory of Tours. The latter, in
particular, offer an actually inexhaustible mine
of information concerning the medical activity
of Christian saints.</p>

<p>It does not, however, appear that this medical
activity enjoyed the confidence of priests or of
laymen to such an extent that the services of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
professional physician were entirely discarded.
It is true, Gregory of Tours expresses himself in
reference to the terrestrial physicians in a manner
which is by no means complimentary, for he
says:</p>

<p>“What are they (the physicians) able to accomplish
with their instruments? Their office
is rather to cause pain than to alleviate it; if they
open the eye and cut into it with pointed lancets,
they surely cause the agony of death to come in
sight before assisting in the recovery of vision,
and if all precautionary measures are not thoroughly
carried out the power of sight is lost forever.
Our beloved saint, however, has only one
instrument of steel, and that is his will, and only
one salve, and that is his curative power.”</p>

<p>But in spite of this want of confidence in physicians,
Gregory of Tours did not hesitate eventually
to interfere quite extensively with the
practise of the saints by the employment of ordinary
medicine.</p>

<p>At least, he frequently did so when he felt sick
himself. Thus, one day, when he was afflicted
with severe bellyache, he employed warm poultices
and baths, and only when the refractory
abdomen gave him no rest, after a continuance
of this treatment for six days, did Gregory apply
to <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin. When, at another time, Gregory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was affected with so severe an attack that his
death was believed to be imminent, he caused
himself at first to be treated according to all the
rules of medical science, and not until improvement
failed to appear, did he think of the aid of
the saints. Then he spoke to his physician as
follows: “Well, you have exhausted all remedies
of your art, you have used up all your powers
and juices, but the remedies of this world do not
help him who is destined to die. Only one thing
remains for me to do. I shall tell you the great
remedy: take some stone powder from the grave
of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin and prepare it for me.”</p>

<p>The healing of the sick by the power of the
saints and through relics was in favor throughout
the middle ages, and even in the sixteenth
century it was so generally in vogue that a physician
by the name of Wyer (1515 to 1588) considered
it expedient to demonstrate the incredibility
of such heavenly interference.</p>

<p>It is by no means my intention to hold solely
dogmatic Christendom of the middle ages and
the Christian priest responsible for the monstrous
superstition into which, according to the
above description, Christian religion had degenerated
in the domain of medicine. This superstition
resulted from the cooperation of quite
incongruous factors; but we can by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
exempt the Christian priest entirely from blame,
in that he assisted very materially in furthering
it. For we must bear in mind that the Christian
cloister of the middle ages was not only the last
refuge of humanistic culture, but the science
of medicine found an asylum of preeminent importance
within its precincts. Medicine had
taken refuge in the cloister from the storms and
tribulations which followed the political collapse
of antiquity and from the excitement of national
migrations, and had here attained a high degree
of perfection. In fact, we may contend, without
exaggeration, that at certain periods of the middle
ages the Christian monastery had the importance
as a medical school which was later on
claimed by the university; for the Christian
monks not only nursed the sick and practised
medicine, but also took an interest in its scientific
development. They were well acquainted with
the medical classics of ancient times, such as
Hippocrates, Herophilus, Dioscorides, Galen,
Paul of Ægina, and others, as well as with the
ancient medical celebrities of second and third
rank. Briefly, medical knowledge in its entirety
was contained in the cloisters of the middle
ages; the cloisters, indeed, furnished a considerably
larger quota of the medical profession
than the laity. In such a state of affairs it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
might have been expected that the monks and
priests should have applied their extensive medical
knowledge to combat the terrible abuses
which had invaded medicine in connection with
the names and the bones of the saints. But this
they never did, neither during the middle ages
or later on. Priesthood has never seriously attempted
to promote medical enlightenment. On
the contrary, plenty of writings exist in which
the crassest superstition in medico-physical affairs
was defended by the clergy, who quite frequently
exhibit the same spirit while practising
medicine. Medical relief obtained by entirely
terrestrial remedies they speedily placed to the
credit of the saints, as was done, for instance, by
the monks of Monte Cassino, when (as we have
seen above) they persuaded the emperor Henry
<abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr> that not the temporal hands of the friar physicians
had performed an operation for stone
upon him, but that <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict in person had,
with his own holy hands, extracted the stone
from the imperial bladder.</p>

<p>By leading the laity, in numerous cases and
against their better knowledge and conscience,
to believe that the aid of the saints, and of the
relics originating from them, was far superior to
medical services, the Christian priests of the
middle ages have on their part contributed quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a considerable share to the horrors of medical
superstition. It is true, we must not overlook
the fact that monks and priests of the middle
ages were the product of their time, in the same
manner as we of modern times are the product
of our period. And as the middle ages formed
an era of miracles, of demons, devils, and witches,
numerous members of the clergy, as children of
their time, surely had an essentially different
opinion of the belief in miracles and demons from
that which we have. The conception of miracles
was entirely different during the middle ages
from what it is in modern times; for the sincere
and firm belief in the omnipotence of the one
God, which with Christianity had taken possession
of the world, had firmly fixed in the Christian
mind of that period the idea that God was
able at any moment to manifest his omnipotence
by changing the course of terrestrial phenomena,
and actually did manifest it. Thus to a Christian
of the middle ages it did not appear miraculous
that an alteration in the course of natural law
should occur. It was considered quite conceivable
that the same natural phenomena should
spring from one cause to-day and from a different
one to-morrow, according to the pleasure of
God; it would have been just as inconceivable to
the early Christians, and to their later coreligionists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the middle ages, that all natural processes
are carried into effect according to eternally
unalterable laws, beyond the interference
of divinity, as it is incomprehensible to us to
conceive that God would at any time change a
law of nature in favor of one or the other mortal
being. The conception of miracle during the
first sixteen centuries of the Christian era was
entirely different from that of the subsequent era.
We must not, therefore, gauge the ideas of priests
and laymen of those centuries who believed in
medical miracles by the same standard as that
by which we judge those who to-day still persist
in admitting the existence of medico-physical
wonder or miracle. It is highly probable that,
under conditions as described above, many Christian
monks and priests vacillated between the
requirements of faith and the results of their own
medical knowledge. The medieval scholar’s
feeling drew him to one side, his intelligence to
the other, and thus he became destitute of a firm
hold—the intellectual sport of his period and of
his environment. That prominent lights of the
Church could become subject to such vacillations
we learn from Gregory of Tours, who attempted
to cure bodily ailments at one time with the
medicaments of professional medicine, at other
times with the saving means of the celestial drug-store;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
who at one time deprecated the art of
temporal physicians in favor of medically skilled
saints, at other times fled to human medicine for
refuge.</p>

<p>Finally the position of the medically learned
monk and priest with reference to the general
public, during the middle ages, was by no means
an easy or an agreeable one. The people clung
with invincible tenacity to the belief in demons
and miracles. Ancient as well as Christian
philosophy was firmly pledged to a belief in
demons, whose existence was supported by the
sacred testimony of the Gospel. It is not astonishing,
therefore, that the people should cling to
their belief in various forms of supernatural interference
with the functions of organic beings, and
thus it may frequently have happened that a
medically enlightened priest, fearing the opposition
of a people eager after celestial medicine,
sacrificed his scientific convictions to the caprices
of a mistaken faith. Unfortunately, only a few
had in them the making of a scientific martyr,
and the history of Christianity teaches us that it
is much easier to be a martyr of faith than a
martyr of science.</p>

<p>But what has been stated thus far will by no
means acquit the Christian priest of blame which
he incurred by favoring medical superstition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
such acquittal would be radically futile. But we
mean to show that the conduct of the servants of
our faith, altho not pardonable, is quite explicable.
The historian, in order to present to his
readers the relation which had gradually formed
between Christianity and medical superstition,
must show himself prosecutor and defendant at
the same time.</p>

<p>Equally with dogma and priesthood, theistic
belief also has been a powerful instrument in the
furthering of medical superstition, and this point
we shall next consider.</p>

<p>§9. <b>Theistic Thought as the Fosterer of
Medical Superstition.</b>—Altho the theist, by
accepting a physico-mechanical interpretation of
natural phenomena, abandoned his main position,
yet the theistic belief by no means became
obsolete—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the belief that God, unrestricted
by natural laws, personally directed terrestrial
manifestations still held its ground. This belief
remained dominant in many minds, in spite of
all that philosophers and naturalists said in regard
to the forms and life of organic structures.
The vitality which this belief has shown during
the development of our race is actually astonishing.
In spite of the wide acceptance of the
physico-mechanical theory of life, the belief that
God, without regard to natural laws, unceasingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
interfered with the course of natural
events, and, consequently, also with the conditions
of the human body, has not only remained
active, but has even succeeded in recovering an
extensive part of its lost ground. We shall soon
see that this is a repetition of what has occurred
during all periods of human development. Even
to-day, when the mechanical theory of life has
won its greatest triumphs, and more than twenty
centuries have passed since the great Hippocrates
preached a theory of medicine, purified
from all theistic and theurgic accretions, individuals
are still met with who presuppose the
therapeutic activity of God in all cases of disease
as a self-evident fact. Such a condition of
opinion, history teaches us, always prevails at
periods, during which a craving for religious excitement
becomes excessively acute. It is either
a new form of religion which so preoccupies the
public mind and the intelligence that all phenomena
are conceived of as in closest relationship
with God, or else some individual appears
who, carried away by religious enthusiasm,
teaches that the existence of nature independent
of God is not admissible, and succeeds
in enlisting numerous followers under his banner.
Under similar conditions theistic belief
had occasionally succeeded in regaining its supremacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in the domain of medicine. In taking
up the consideration of some such instances we
can only treat them briefly, as an exhaustive
handling of this most interesting material would
carry us too far away from our present subject.</p>

<p>The belief that God was the best physician,
not only of the soul but of the body also, was
deepened by the dissemination of Christianity.
The sincerity of faith among the Christians of
the first century was so intense that a great
number of them believed that their bodily welfare
could not be watched over more carefully
than when it was commended exclusively to the
care of God in all cases of sickness. Accordingly,
they entirely neglected medical aid and
treated all diseases only by prayers, by anointing,
and by laying on of hands. This mode of
treatment corresponds to what is contained in
the epistle of James <abbr class="ni" title="5">v</abbr> : 14-16—</p>

<p>“Is any sick among you? let him call for the
elders of the church; and let them pray over
him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord:</p>

<p>“And the prayer of faith shall save the sick,
and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>

<p>“Confess your faults one to another, and pray
one for another, that ye may be healed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much.”</p>

<p>The extent of this treatment by prayer is
shown by the fact that even prominent fathers
of the Church—for instance, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict (died
543)—were addicted to it.</p>

<p>Moreover, an attempt was made to increase
the therapeutic value of prayer by various accessories
and aids. Thus the Gospel was placed
upon the affected part of the body, or clothing
of a particularly pious man was spread over the
patient. It appears that the sudarium and the
coat of the apostle Paul were held to possess such
healing power, and were, therefore, frequently
employed as instruments of healing. Thus
we read in the Act of the Apostles <abbr class="ni" title="19">xix</abbr> : 12—“So
that from his body were brought unto the
sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases
departed from them, and the evil spirits went
out of them.”</p>

<p>In fact, medical superstition went so far that
it divined a potent curative virtue even in the
shadow of the apostle Peter. Thus, Acts <abbr class="ni" title="5">v</abbr> : 15—“Insomuch
that they brought forth the sick
into the streets, and laid them on beds and
couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing
by might overshadow some of them.”</p>

<p>Probably we shall not be wrong in regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
this procedure as the origin of that relic cult
which was destined to attain such astonishing
dimensions in medical practise.</p>

<p>The mode of treatment by means of prayer
was, perhaps, intimately connected with the idea
that bodily ailments were divinely ordained to
make the wrath of God distinctly perceptible by
man. This conception of pathological processes
was a very ancient one. We meet with it among
the Egyptians, and we read in the book of Exodus
that God visited upon Pharaoh and his people
various bodily afflictions, such as pestilence,
black smallpox, death, as in the case of the first-born.
Afterward Christianity adopted this view
of sickness as providential, and the belief assumed
very peculiar forms and dimensions in the
middle ages. In those times any disease occurring
epidemically was actually considered to be
an act of retribution on the part of the divine
being, a scourge with which God punished sinful
Christians. Thus, for instance, syphilis, which
originated in Naples in 1495, during the struggle
between the reigning house of Aragon and the
French, was instantly declared to be the chastisement
of God. The emperor Maximilian declares,
in an edict issued August 7, 1495, at Worms:
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod novus ille et gravissimus hominum morbus
nostris diebus exortus, quem vulgo malum Francicum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
vocant, post hominum memoriam inauditus sæpe
grassetur, quæ nos justissimæ Dei iræ merita debent
admonere</i>” (Gregorovius <abbr class="ni" title="7">VII.</abbr>, 386, foot-note 1).</p>

<p>But it is very astonishing to observe the causes
which aroused the wrath of God so mightily that
countless numbers of men were swept away.
Thus, for instance, the pious Bishop of Zeeland,
Peter Paladius, assures us that miliary fever,
that terrible disease which devastated Europe
five times from 1486 to 1551, was sent by God,
who was angry at the excessive passion for finery
which prevailed at that time. Medical science,
as founded on theism, assumed menacing forms,
where, in the middle ages, it associated itself
with magic, but as we shall more exhaustively
enlarge upon this point in Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="4">IV.</abbr> we need
merely refer here to that part of our work.</p>

<p>It is indeed surprising that the above-mentioned
manifestations all occurred in periods in
which medicine had already acknowledged the
physico-mechanical interpretation of all organic
processes; but the strangeness of this fact is enhanced
by the consideration that, even in recent
times, and even at the present moment, there
have been, and are, individuals who not only
preach the doctrine that medicine is bound to be
subordinate to Christian faith, but also find adherents
to their dogmas, and find them in surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
numbers. Recently we have learned
from two exceedingly instructive examples to
what extremes the sentiment of fanatical religion
may lead men so soon as they shake off the
steadying influence of physico-mechanical ideas
in their theory of life. Then Theocracy strives for
an exclusive ascendancy in the domain of medicine,
as is distinctly shown by the position taken
by Mrs. Eddy, with her “Christian Science,”
and Rev. John Alexander Dowie, with his
“Christian Catholic Church of Zion.”</p>

<p>If we first of all examine the system of Mrs.
Eddy, we find it an absurd farrago of undigested
philosophical odds and ends, illogical medical
aphorisms, and shallow investigation, which
reaches its pitch of folly in the belief that disease
has no real foundation in the material tissues
of the body, but should be explained as arising
exclusively from certain conditions of the mind.
In accordance with this conception, which has
been borrowed from a natural philosophy
long since relegated to oblivion, the services
both of physician and physic are to be rejected,
and the treatment of the sick is to be carried on
in such a manner that the patient, under supervision
of an individual expert in such affairs, is
merely to fix his mind on the spiritual, or divine,
principle inherent in himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>We are by no means astonished that a person
to whom the laws of thought are entirely unfamiliar,
and who is not very much burdened
with knowledge of any other kind, should advance
such confused and preposterous theories
as those of Mrs. Eddy. History teaches us that
human beings have arisen at all periods, in all
ranks of life, and in cold blood have given currency
to the wildest of theories. But the most
interesting point is that at this day when, as we
might believe, the advances in physical science
have enlightened to some extent even the most
unintellectual, Mrs. Eddy is able to find adherents,
especially among the best classes of
society, and to find them in such numbers that
the authorities have been compelled to interfere
in repressing the practises of this medical superstition.
I purposely say interesting, and not
“astonishing” or “wonderful,” because the
historian, whatever domain he undertakes to investigate,
will always discover that stupidity has
at all times been a power superior to all the influences
of culture and learning. Mrs. Eddy,
with her Christian Science, proves to us that even
in this era of scientific enlightenment, this truth
remains incontrovertible.</p>

<p>Rev. John Alexander Dowie, with his Christian
Catholic Church of Zion, must be judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from an entirely different view-point than Mrs.
Eddy. It is true, this latter-day saint arrives at
exactly the same end as Mrs. Eddy—namely, at
the absolute rejection of professional treatment,
medical as well as surgical. But he arrives at
this theory, which so closely concerns both his
own health and that of his adherents, by an
entirely different way from that taken by the
Eddy woman. An unquestioning belief, which
in its naïveté is almost touching, leads him to
hold that all utterances of the Old as well as of
the New Testament are direct revelations of God.
The further consequence of this constancy of
faith is the desire to believe and to follow everything
that is contained in the Bible, to the
widest extent and with the closest adherence to
the wording of the book. And as the book of Exodus,
<abbr class="ni" title="15">xv</abbr> : 26, states, “I am the Lord that healeth
thee,” and in the Epistle to James, <abbr class="ni" title="5">v</abbr> : 14-16,
prayer is recommended as the best remedy in
diseases, Dowie concludes that prayer must be
resorted to as the sole means of treating and curing
all forms of disease. Prayer is declared by
him to be much more efficacious, in surgical
cases, than the skill of the most experienced
operator.</p>

<p>Dowie, therefore, occupies exactly the same
standpoint as the Christians of the first centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
after Christ, who also believed that prayer would
render the best assistance in all ailments of the
body. Twenty centuries, therefore, with all
their immense advance in the training of thought
and in the recognition of nature, have not been
able to rid humanity of the conception that the
omnipotence of God, among many other manifestations,
is to busy itself in the daily regulation
of the human body with all its numerous functions.
Wherever this conception obtains a firm
foothold superstition, with its acts of miraculous
healing, never fails to follow. Accordingly, all
historic periods of our cultural development, in
which the theocratic belief has been on the
ascendant, are characterized by an excessive
development of medical superstition.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p class="st2">THE INFLUENCE OF PHILOSOPHY UPON THE
FORM AND ORIGIN OF MEDICAL
SUPERSTITION</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> idea that philosophy has exerted any material
influence upon superstition in medicine
may appear strange to many. For how can it
be possible that the science which teaches the
laws of thought, which regulates our entire mental
activity and guides it in the right direction,
which points out to us the intricate path of medical
theory and diagnosis—how is it possible that
just this science should either take or have taken
part in misleading or obscuring our medical perception?
We do not by any means intend to
impute any such effect to philosophy. Quite
the contrary! We are thoroughly aware of the
great influence which philosophy is entitled to
claim in all sciences without exception, and for
this reason we believe that modern representatives
of medical science would be much better
off if they were a little less at variance with
philosophy than they actually are.</p>

<p>In the wide realm of philosophy there are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
certain points where we can detect a tendency to
promote the development of medical superstition.
This tendency appears in all endeavors
which are made to explain natural phenomena
solely in a speculative manner, or to build a
theory of life upon a base of pure assumptions.
Whenever such attempts were made manifest, and
impressed philosophy into their service under the
name of natural philosophy, it resulted in the
wide predominance of medical superstition.</p>

<p>It is well known that all prae-Socratic philosophy
aimed at the discovery of a single principle
as underlying and explaining all the phenomena
of nature. But in spite of this very apparent
tendency, it can scarcely be accused of promoting
medical superstition; for prae-Socratic
philosophy busied itself in speculations concerning
terrestrial phenomena. Earth and air, fire
and water, cold and heat, coming into being
and passing away, are the things in which it
endeavored to find the elemental basis of nature
with its multiform phenomena. But upon the
study of medicine these endeavors exercised, for
the time being, a liberalizing influence. They
emancipated it from the repressive grasp of
theism, and opened up the way for an exclusively
natural explanation of all processes of the
body, in health as well as in sickness. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the apparatus, or organon, which philosophy
furnished to science in its terrestrial
phenomena was a very questionable one, investigation
of the conclusion from analogy and the
deductive method being of extremely little value,
either in medical diagnosis or the pursuit of natural
science. For this reason medicine was bound
to be encumbered with countless badly founded
hypotheses. But other monstrous guesses at
truth could not fail to become current. Let us
consider, for instance, the absurd theory which
Heraclitus of Ephesus (500 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>) has propounded
as to the relations between wine and the human
soul. As the soul, according to this philosopher,
naturally was a fiery vapor, and the drier
and the more fiery it remained the better, the
excessive use of alcohol would not be advisable,
in that the abundant infusion of fluids causes
the soul to become wet, which would be harmful
to its fiery nature, as fire and moisture are always
incompatible. Who will venture to deny that
it was from his opinion regarding the use of
wine that Heraclitus acquired his sobriquet of
“Whining Philosopher”?</p>

<p>But curious as were all the hypotheses with
which Hellenic natural philosophy foisted upon
medicine, they should by no means be confounded
with superstition, for even a baseless hypothesis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
is far removed from superstition. Otherwise,
medicine and superstition would be almost
identical conceptions, for baseless hypotheses
have at no time been wanting in our science.
Superstition, so far as its sources are found in
philosophy, did not enter medical science until
philosophy sought for an explanation of the
various processes of life not only in material but
also in immaterial forces. And as Indian as well
as Persian philosophy, in the earliest period of
its existence known to us, had already found in
demons the immaterial elements which to a great
extent control the processes of life in man, it
will be seen that the relations between philosophy
and medical superstition are quite old. The
Hellenic poets and philosophers, Homer, Hesiod,
Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato, elaborated
this immemorial doctrine of demons and introduced
it into Greece. But the recognition of
immaterial, supernatural curative factors did not
attain any considerable and determining influence
in ancient medicine until the year 150 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>,
when, under the eager advocacy of Alexandrian
Jews, Oriental and Occidental doctrines became
amalgamated to a coherent system of theosophic
and medical mysticism. Medicine suffered
greatly for centuries from this mysticism,
which prevailed late in the middle ages and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
up to more recent times. The center of all the
various forms under which speculations in the
philosophical and theosophical domain made
their appearance was Alexandria, the great central
point of culture in which the civilization of
the Orient and the Occident were united in the
evolution of a new theory of life. But that the
birthplace of developments so momentous for
the future of medicine should be Alexandria
almost suggests the thought that the writers of
history were indulging in a satire upon medical
science; for it is well known that Alexandria
was the very place where medical enlightenment
and the progress of ancient medicine won their
greatest triumphs under the renowned anatomists,
Herophilus and Erasistratus.</p>

<p>Such speculations in theosophical and medical
domains at first were most eagerly entered upon
by the Jewish sects of the Essenians, or Essenes,
and Therapeutæ. According to the description
which Josephus (Book 2, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 13)
has left us of these two sects, they were theosophical
communists. We, as physicians, however,
are principally interested in the position
they took with regard to our profession, and
that was one of indifference. They believed that
they should not obtain their knowledge of the
body, either in health or in disease, by observation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on which physicians relied. They believed
they could actually learn the art of healing from
a study of their old Sacred Scriptures. For that
reason they especially applied themselves to
make a diligent examination of these Holy Scriptures.
They believed that they were able, by
various allegorical interpretations of different
letters and words, as well as by subtle explanations
of this or that sentence, to acquire the
knowledge necessary for the treatment of their
patients. Those, however, who had become imbued
with this wisdom of dotage in an especial
degree, claimed the possession of numerous
miraculous powers—for instance, that of prediction.
But as they also believed in the existence
of beings who, while they were lower than God,
at the same time were higher than man, they
had, ready at hand, the rarest resources to draw
upon for the practise of their juggling feats of
miraculous medicine. The belief in these mystical
doctrines took the most extravagant forms.
Thus, for instance, it was believed that a man by
the evacuation of feces offered an insult to divinity
(<span title="tas augas hubrizein tou theou">τὰς αὐγὰς ὑβρίζειν τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, says Josephus,
lib. 2, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="8">VIII.</abbr>, No. 9, § 15). For that
reason nobody might dare, on the Sabbath, to
comply with such demands of nature. But
whether the call of nature always yielded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
these rather far-reaching requirements of the
law, or how the believer helped himself when
the extremely disagreeable dissension between
nature and faith caused too much uneasiness,
is not reported either by Josephus or by Porphyrius.
Besides, the Essenians had their
troubles even on week-days in attending to final
phases of the digestive process, in that it was
incumbent upon them to conceal the termination
of the act of digestion from the view of the
Supreme Being by covering themselves with a
cloak.</p>

<p>Subsequently, during the first century of the
Christian era, appeared Neo-Pythagorism, an attempt
to combine monotheism with the ancient
fantastic cult of subordinate gods and demons.
Then followed a period of momentous importance
for medicine; for the attempt to displace
the physico-mechanical conception of corporeal
phenomena by various ideas of theosophic caprice,
and to bring therapeutics once more under
the domination of the metaphysic methods,
prevalent in the days when the theistic theory of
life held undisputed sway in medicine and natural
sciences, became more and more apparent.
The Neo-Pythagoreans acted upon the principle
that the practise of medicine was absolutely indispensable
to the true philosopher, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
every one, therefore, provided he had attained
the required fitness by his intercourse with demons,
was able to act as a physician. It is
quite obvious that such ideas were bound to pave
the way for the most abominable abuse and superstitions,
and, naturally, what the Neo-Pythagoreans
offered as the art of healing to the
patients was nothing but a mixture of mysterious
customs, conjurations, and witchcraft. On the
other hand, the followers of this school of philosophy
did much to promote the bodily welfare
of their fellow men, in that they urged them to
lead a pure and temperate life, while they themselves
appear to have adhered strictly to this
régime.</p>

<p>The chief representative of Neo-Pythagorism
was Apollonius, of Tyana, in Cappodocia, probably
one of the most fantastic personages of all
Greek and Roman antiquity. Venerated as a
god by some of his contemporaries, such as
Damis and Philostratus, his biographers, on account
of his wisdom and of his extraordinary
works, he is considered by others, on the other
hand, as a magician engaged, like a common
charlatan, in conjuring tricks. The opinions
which posterity, down to modern times, has
passed on Apollonius are of a similar nature.
There are some who consider the Tyanian to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a crafty magician, whereas others declare that
he is an important personality in the history of
religion. Among these latter is Baur, who attempts
to explain the life and the deeds of the
wonder-working Neo-Pythagorean by citing as a
parallel the impression created by Christianity
upon some enlightened minds.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider this high estimate of a
trickster to be perfectly absurd. Apollonius, as
we meet him in the celebrated description of
Philostratus, is a purely poetical idealization,
prompted by a desire to delay the downfall of
ancient religion, pointing to the reform which has
been instituted in its moral tendencies (Gregorovius,
page 413).</p>

<p>Apollonius flourished in the first Christian
century, during the reigns of Nero and of the
succeeding emperors up to Nerva, who appears
to have been in very close relations with him.
The accounts of Philostratus regarding the
adventures of our hero, based as they are upon
the early authorities accessible to him, absolutely
create the impression that heathen antiquity
meant in Apollonius to set a counterpart
of Christ. According to ancient reports, a supernatural
apparition visited his mother, apprizing
her that she would bear a god, and after his
death Apollonius appeared to his disciples to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
announce to them the immortality of the soul.
The time between the birth and death of the
Tyanian was spent by him in restless wanderings
over the then known world. Wherever he went
he conversed on the deepest subjects with priests
and cultured laymen, and upon request he also
performed miracles of various kinds. Naturally,
we are only interested in the medical performances
of the wandering philosopher, and of these
he is credited with a considerable number. He
cured the lame simply by stroking the affected
limbs; with equal facility he gave sight to the
blind—in fact, he even attended to obstetrical
cases without fear and trepidation. For instance,
when the husband of a woman who had borne
seven children, but always with the greatest difficulty,
came to Apollonius, sadly telling him that
his wife was again in labor and nobody was able
to help her, the man of miracles told him to be of
good cheer. Without even examining the woman
for a possible narrow pelvis, or for some other
obstacle to birth, he simply advised the husband
to procure, as soon as possible, a living hare, and,
with this hare in his arms, to walk round and
round the woman in labor, and then allow the
hare to run away. This one sample of his medical
activity is sufficient to characterize Apollonius
as a charlatan of the most contemptible class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
When we learn, further, that he raised the dead
without any difficulty, nobody will probably accuse
us of an unjust opinion if we pronounce this
philosopher, who was revered as a god by the
heathen, a magician of the worst kind.</p>

<p>In order duly to enhance his authority Apollonius
arrogated to himself certain mysterious
powers. Thus, he pretended that he was able
to speak all languages without having ever
learned them; in fact, this philological talent
even extended to the languages of the animals,
which he undertook to master. We are scarcely
surprised to learn, when we consider the powers
bestowed upon him, that he knew the future, and
was thoroughly aware of what happened at the
same time at the most distant parts of the world.
He also endeavored to bear witness to his vocation
as a man of God by his manner of living
and of dressing. Thus he was always attired in
white linen garments, and walked about with
long, flowing hair, followed by his disciples. He
never ate meat, never partook of wine, and disdained
love. It would seem, however, that in
the last particular he was not quite consistent—at
least, various erotic adventures are related
of him.</p>

<p>The manner in which Apollonius cast out a
demon in India is extremely amusing. A woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
came, lamenting and crying, to the medical miracle
worker, and asked him to deliver her sixteen-year-old
son from an evil spirit. Apollonius at
once gave her a letter directed to the evil spirit
which contained, as Philostratus emphasizes
particularly, the most terrible threats against the
good-for-nothing tormentor. But the biographer
does not tell us whether the reading of this letter
caused the demon to desist from his improper
behavior.</p>

<p>But as even in a man of miracles the hour-glass
of life finally is emptied, so also a time came
when Apollonius realized that he must pay his last
debt to nature. But the Tyanian knew how to
surround even the act of dying with a halo of the
extraordinary. As a matter or fact, he did not
die; but one day—if it is permissible to employ
a trivial expression in speaking of a demi-god—he
evaporated without anybody knowing what
had become of him. This evaporation occurred
in the following manner. There was in Crete a
temple of Dictynna so securely guarded by
vicious dogs that no one dared to approach.
This temple was entered by Apollonius, whom
the furious dogs left unmolested; but, after the
doors of the sanctuary had closed behind the
Pythagorean, suddenly there resounded female
voices singing from the depth of the temple:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“Leave the earth! Go heavenward!” With
these sounds and words Apollonius disappeared
forever. Thus his last medical act was a sleight-of-hand
performance, in that he even snapped
his fingers at death.</p>

<p>The grateful heathen world of antiquity
rendered divine honors to Apollonius. In his
birth-place, Tyana, a temple was erected in
his honor at imperial expense, and the priests
everywhere erected statues to a philosopher
who had left this world without dying; in fact,
even the Emperor Alexander Severus set up
an image of Apollonius in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lararium</i>, or
domestic chapel. And thus to medical superstition
was accorded a triumph which no
legitimate practitioner of any age has ever enjoyed.</p>

<p>These theosophic vagaries reached their climax
in Neo-Platonism, which was founded toward the
end of the second century of the Christian era
by the Alexandrian porter, Ammonius (175 to
242), and was further elaborated by Plotinus
(204 to 269). This religious, philosophical system
is of very particular interest in the history
of medicine in that, in the first place, it stands
in direct opposition to the physico-mechanical
conception of disease, and, explaining sickness
from a theistic standpoint as a logical consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rejects the treatment of disease by professional
physicians.</p>

<p>Now this theistic conception of disease was
based primarily upon the assumption that the
universe is filled with countless demons, spirits
which, altho essentially superior to man, are inferior
to God. Such a demon was supposed to
be the “spiritus rector” of all terrestrial occurrences,
especially all evil events were attributed
to him. <span title="oti autoi aitioi gignomenoi tôn Peri

de Abst., lib. 2, 40). As the demons played
havoc with the condition of the human body,
protection against them could not be expected
from a professional physician, but only from
some one well versed in all their tricks and
devices, and, therefore, alone able to punish
them thoroughly for their mischievous behavior.
This taming of the demon could be accomplished
in various ways. Porphyrius enumerates three
methods of gaining an influence over the host
of demons.</p>

<p>The first and principal method (theosophy) attempted
to attain the most intimate union with
God. Prayer, abstraction of all thought from
things earthly, and absorption in God were supposed
to be the means of participation in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
divine powers. An individual thus favored was
enabled in a trice to restore health to incurable
patients, such as the blind, the deaf, and the
lame, and even the power of raising the dead
was conferred upon him. However, the acquisition
of such extraordinary powers demanded
certain qualifications of a rather exacting and
terrestrial character. It was incumbent upon
such an applicant for these special gifts to abstain
from the use of meat, and, above all, from
the society of women. How many were deterred
by these fastidious requirements from choosing
the career of a famous man of miracles we do not
know. Nothing is reported on this subject by
the pillars of Neo-Platonism (as, Plotinus, Porphyrius,
Damascius, Jamblichus), nor do they
state whether they themselves absolutely abstained
from meat and from the society of
women.</p>

<p>Theurgy was the second method of counteracting
the evil influence of demons. In this way
good demons were urged by prayer and offerings
to ward off disease or other misfortune.</p>

<p>By the third method (goety) attempts were
made to dispel the evil demons by conjurations
and various kinds of mystical mummery. These
mysterious accessories consisted mostly in muttering
any number of words as meaningless as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
possible. The more meaningless and the more
unintelligible were these words the more efficacious—according
to the assurance of Jamblichus—they
would prove, especially when they were
taken from Oriental languages. For, as Jamblichus
says, the Oriental languages are the most
ancient—therefore, the most agreeable to the
gods. In such a manner words utterly nonsensical
were drawled out at the bedside, and, for
greater security, written on tablets to be hung
round the neck of the patient. The magic word
“abracadabra” enjoyed especial respect. To
render its power certain it was written as many
times as it has letters, omitting the last letter
each time until only one remained, and placing
the words in such a succession as to form an
equilateral triangle. A tablet thus inscribed was
worn around the neck of the sufferer as an amulet.
It may be that this wonder-working word
has arisen from the word “abraxas,” with which
the gnostic Basilides meant to designate the
aggregate of the three hundred and sixty-five
forms of revelation of divinity which he assumed
to exist. Numerous other explanations
are in vogue, however, with regard to this medical,
magic term (compare Häser, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, page
433). Very ancient magic words which had
originated in the earliest periods of Hellenism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
were revived. Thus, to banish disease, certain
words were employed which were said to be derived
from the temple of Artemis in Ephesus,
and which read: <span title="aschi, Kataschi, lie, tetrae, damnameneus, aisson">ασχι, Κατάσχι, λίε, τετράε,
δαμναμενεύς, αἲσσον.</span> The meaning of these
words, according to the explanation of the Pythagorean,
Androcydes, was: darkness, light,
earth, air, sun, truth. Besides, the attempt was
made to obtain directly from the demons such
magic words as were endowed with curative
power. For such purposes small children were
employed, in whom it was supposed that the
demons preferred to be present, and expressed
themselves through their mouths. Such children,
therefore, played a similar part as does a
medium with modern spiritualists. The senseless
stuff babbled by such a child was considered
the immediate manifestation of a demon, and
was accordingly utilized to banish the demons
which brought on disease. Moreover, the nonsensical
practise which was carried on by the
Neo-Platonists by letter and word was to a certain
extent accepted by professional physicians.
It had become a very common custom with
physicians to apply various kinds of bombastic
names to all their various plasters and ointments,
powders, and pills. It is necessary only
to cast a glance upon the ancient pharmacopœia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to find the most curious names. Galen mentions
disapprovingly the fact that Egyptian and Babylonian
expressions were preferred in the nomenclature
of medicine (De Simpl. Medicamentorum
Facult. Lib. Sic. Preface).</p>

<p>Such were the methods with which the Neo-Platonists
did not hesitate to treat the sick; and
not only minor practitioners, but even the leaders
of the entire movement, preferred banishing disease
by means of various kinds of magic formulæ
to all other specially medical methods of treatment.
Thus, for instance, Eunapius of Sardis
(about 400) recounts how Plotinus, one of the
most gifted of the Neo-Platonic school, repeatedly
proved himself to be a medical miracle-worker,
most conspicuously during the sickness
of Porphyrius. When the latter, a favorite disciple
of Plotinus, was traveling through Sicily
he became dangerously ill—in fact, according to
the description of Eunapius, he was actually
breathing his last. Then Plotinus appeared, and
by magic words cured the dying man instantly.
It appears, moreover, that Plotinus did not only
operate with wonder-working words, but he employed
still other agencies—as, for instance, mysterious
figures (<span title="hochêmata">ὁχήματα</span>. Villoison, Anecd.
græca, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 231). Plotinus was even
said to possess his own demon, who was at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
disposal alone, and by the aid of whom he performed
other wonders—as, for instance, that of
prophesying.</p>

<p>Porphyrius, probably the most notable disciple
of the Neo-Platonic school after Plotinus, claimed
even that the demons personally taught him to
expel, with certainty and despatch, those pathogenic
demons. It was claimed by him that Chaldean
and Hebrew words and songs were the
promptest means of turning out all these evil
spirits; in fact, the philosopher, Alexander of
Abonoteichos, in Paphlagonia, was of the opinion
that a pestilence, which was devastating
Italy, could not be checked by any better means
than that of affixing to the doors of the
infected towns and villages the sentence:
“Phœbus, the hair unshorn, dispels the clouds
of disease.”</p>

<p>Thus the last great system into which the ancient
philosophy developed was attended by the
unfortunate result of a very material increase of
superstition in the healing art. This recrudescence
of medical superstition was by no means
a transitory one, but proved exceedingly persistent;
in fact, we may unhesitatingly maintain
that from that time superstition never again
disappeared from our science. This is principally
the fault of the position which Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
took with regard to demonology and the other
fantastic ideas of Neo-Platonism.</p>

<p>Early Christianity, from the outset, was subjected
to the influence of ancient false ideas on
the subject of demons. Without making any
modifications whatever, it had appropriated this
false doctrine, and had deduced from it the same
medical notions as paganism had done. The
New Testament exhibits numerous examples of
a prevailing belief that supernatural beings—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
demons—were frequently the cause of bodily
ailments; and as Christ and His disciples had
often cured such patients, it follows that the belief
in demons and their relations to pathology
must have been widely disseminated among the
Christians of that period. The Church Fathers
also bear witness to this fact, as they, in their
writings, acknowledge, in plain terms, the belief
in demons as causes of disease. Justin Martyr,
Tatian, Tertullian, Origen, Augustin, all mention
demons and their power over the human
body (compare Harnack, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="5">V.</abbr>, page 68,
etc., where these conditions are most lucidly depicted).
Thus, for instance, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine says:
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accipiunt (scilicet dæmones) enim sæpe potestatem
et morbos immittere et ipsum aerem vitiando morbidum
reddere.</i>”</p>

<p>And, indeed, early Christianity not only accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pagan demonology unchanged, it even
increased the therapeutic aspect of this delusion
in a most regrettable manner. This belief in
demons, under the influence of Christian doctrines,
developed into an epidemic of insanity
which prevailed unrestrictedly for two or three
centuries, and which was again awakened in the
late middle ages, to grow at last into one of the
most terrible aberrations of the human mind—into
the belief in witches.</p>

<p>This epidemic derangement of the mind, to
which the belief in demons tended, under the influence
of Christian doctrines, culminated in the
patient’s manifest idea that he was possessed of
a demon. The mental disturbance set in with
wild, spasmodic attacks of excitement, and, as it
occurred not only in individual cases, but was
also contagious, we must not hesitate to designate
this belief of the first three centuries in
demoniac possession an epidemic disease. It
was an affection, the mental substratum of which
consisted in a mixture of overheated religious
sentiment and unrestrained medical superstition.
The extent to which this belief in demoniac possession
was disseminated during the first centuries
of the Christian era is shown by the fact
that a number of persons busied themselves with
the cure of this affection. In the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
most Christian communities owned an exorcist,
or official caster-out of demons. It seems that
this profession of exorcists formed a clerical
order of its own; for, as all pagans, according to
the Christian conception, were in the power of
evil spirits, these demons were to be thoroughly
driven out before each baptism, and thus the institution
of a special church officer, whose duty
it was to drive out demons, became absolutely
necessary, especially after exorcism had also been
introduced, during the fourth century, in the
baptism of children. It may be stated, incidentally,
that Catholic clergy of the third minor
order are even to-day called “exorcists.”</p>

<p>The Christian exorcists, in conjuring, only
made use of prayer and of the name of Christ;
these two factors were considered sufficient to
cure the patient of his delusions, and they actually
did so. Why they accomplished a cure
has been explained very strikingly by Harnack.
He says: “It is not the prayer that cures, but
the praying person; not the formula, but the
spirit; not exorcism, but the exorcist. Only in
those cases in which the disease, as in numerous
cases of the second century, had become epidemic
and almost common, did ordinary and conventional
means avail. The exorcist became a mesmerizer,
possibly a deceived deceiver. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
when strong individuality is deceived concerning
its own personality by the demon of terror, and
the soul is actually shaken by the power of darkness
which possesses it, and from which it purposes
to escape, a powerful and holy will alone
can interfere from the outside world to deliver
the shackled will. In some cases we find traces
of a phenomenon which in modern times, for
want of some better name, has been called ‘suggestion’;
but the prophet suggests in a different
manner than does the professional exorcist.”</p>

<p>Besides these official Christian exorcists, a
great multitude of other persons carried on the
trade of conjurer of demons. The sorcerers and
magicians who plied their nefarious trade for
the cure of the possessed and for those suffering
from other diseases, worked with various
kinds of mystic signs and ceremonies, and they
certainly did an excellent business, for he who
humors the superstition and the stupidity of man
always prospers. Modern quackery illustrates
this most strikingly. But, besides these healers,
there existed numerous other conjurers of demons
and medical wonder-workers who plied their
trade not for the sake of contemptible mammon,
but solely for ethical reasons. These were the
members of the various theosophico-philosophical
sects, who were active during the first Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
centuries and have been exhaustively described
on the previous pages.</p>

<p>Altho Christians were eager to exalt their exorcists,
who worked only with prayer and the
invocation of Christ, above all practises of sorcery,
they were not able, in the long run, to prevent
Christian dogmas from being confounded
with and corrupted by those of philosophy.
Under the influence of Saturninus, Basilides, and
Carpocrates, the various philosophical vagaries
concerning accessory, intermediary, and inferior
gods, and their influences upon the fate of man,
corrupted the pure and simple teachings of
Christ. That error against which Paul had so
impressively cautioned the early Christian communities
in his Epistle to the Colossians, Chapter
<abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, verse 8 (“Beware lest any man spoil you
through philosophy and vain deceit, after the
tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
world, and not after Christ”), had, nevertheless,
made its appearance at last, and the adulteration
of pure Gospel by philosophical speculations and
fantastic views began to grow more complete
from the third century on. This was the foundation
of the religio-mystic system which, during
the middle ages, and even beyond the period of
the Renaissance, oppressed humanity like a suffocating
nightmare, and not only checked progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
but also filled each branch of human knowledge
with the most frightful superstition and the crassest
mysticism. This was the case also in medicine;
in fact, this branch of science has probably
suffered most from the alliance of Christianity
with the fantastic doctrines of philosophical
schools.</p>

<p>The ancient doctrine of demons passed under
the influence of Christian mysticism through certain
changes and transitions, especially in its
relation to the bodily condition of individuals.
The variations in this doctrine were naturally
most plainly evidenced in the medical views of
the day. It was believed that every human being
from birth was allotted a good and an evil
demon. The good spirit held his hand protectingly
over his human charge, whereas the evil
demon only waited his chance to inflict injury
upon man, forming especially the determining
principle in the etiology of disease. It is true,
the evil spirits apparently were no longer allowed
to have such full sway over the health of humanity
as they formerly had. God now utilized them
principally as executors of punishments which
he intended for mankind as a retribution for
various forms of delinquency. Thus the Church
Father, Anastasius (Sprengel, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 210),
tells us that the reason why so many lepers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
cripples were found among Christians was that
God, enraged at the luxury of the members of
the community, had sent the evil demon of disease
among them. The wrath of God from that
time until late in modern times has been considered
a fully efficacious principle of pathology;
in fact, there are numbers of people even to-day
who believe that not natural, but supernatural
and unearthly, factors are active in the bodily
ailments of mankind.</p>

<p>The idea of good and evil demons, however,
now assumed a specifically Christian character
which, it is true, greatly resembled the ancient
Babylonian notion, excepting that the good demons
were replaced by angels and saints, whereas
the evil spirits were embodied in the devil. Both,
saints as well as devils, were thenceforth destined
to play a part in the domain of medicine. It is
true, the general recognition which they enjoyed
during the middle ages and a considerable period
of modern times has probably now passed away,
but there still exist numerous classes of our people
in whom the medical rôle of saints as well as
devils is most willingly acknowledged.</p>

<p>We have referred elsewhere to the therapeutic
accomplishments of the saints during the middle
ages. We will here only dwell upon the influence
which the devil, the Christian successor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the ancient evil spirit, has exerted upon the
medical views of all classes of the people. This
influence was very great. The devil and his subordinate
infernal spirits were considered the
“disturbers of peace” in the health of humanity.
Disease in its various forms was their work;
they resolved to inflict it either from inherent villainy
or as incited by various magical arts of evil
men. It was especially the latter form of diabolical
activity that, during the entire middle
ages and during a considerable part of modern
times, was accepted as uncontestedly authentic,
and the imagination of mankind at that period
was inexhaustible in inventing the greatest variety
of infamous actions which the devil was
able to perform either of his own accord or as
summoned by incantations. Any one desiring to
acquaint himself thoroughly with these delusive
ideas should read the work of the Friar Cæsarius,
who lived about 1225, in the Rhenish-Cistercian
monastery of Heisterbach. Naturally, we are only
interested in the medical acts which the devil
was always ready to perform. According to the
history of medical superstition, the devil, who
was invoked by various spells or appeared of
his own volition, was able to influence each individual
bodily organ in a manner most disagreeable
to the possessor of the same. Neither were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the Prince of Hell and his hosts always satisfied
to tease and to plague an individual being, but
very frequently they carried on this business
wholesale. They threw themselves upon the
entire population of a country, and caused sickness
in all who crossed their path. The great
epidemic of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vitus’s dance of the fourteenth
century, for instance, was considered to be the
work of the devil, and the clergy busied themselves
in driving out this devil’s pest by means
of sprinkling holy water and by the utterance of
conjuring formulas.</p>

<p>The sexual life of men as well as of women
offered an especially fruitful field for the activity
of the devil and of his infernal companions.
Thus, it was a favorite trick of the ruler of hell
and of his subordinate demons to assume the
shape of the husband or lover of this or that
female, and, under this mask, to assume rights
which should be permitted only to the husband.
The infernal spirit that played this rôle was
called Incubus. Thus, for instance, Hinkmer
tells us of a nun who was mischievously claimed
by such an infernal paramour, and who could be
relieved of him only by priestly aid. But hell
also contained female constituents who played
the same rôle for the male as did Incubus for
women. Such a wanton woman of hell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
called Striga or Lamia (compare Hansen, pages
14 and 72). These amorous female friends of
hell did not even stop when they met eminent
saints. In the convent of <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedetto, near
the Italian town of Subiaco, a rose-bush is shown
even to-day into which the naked <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict
threw himself in order to resist the unholy temptation.
And every one is sufficiently acquainted
with the troubles which <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony of Padua
had with these infernal women. However, we
physicians know well enough the cause of these
temptations. They may surely and actually
have approached the nun of whom Hinkmer
reports, also <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict and <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony; however,
they were not the devil’s prostitutes, but
the expressions of suppressed and disregarded
impulses of nature which, in the form of voluptuous
imaginations, appeared before the eyes of
persons removed from terrestrial gratifications;
for nature does not even exempt a saint, and
the ancient saying, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Naturam expellas furcâ,
tamen usque recurret</i>,” applies to them as well
as to any other mortal.</p>

<p>Finally these liberties which the devil and his
infernal host were said to take as regards matters
pertaining to love, assumed general and quite
serious forms; in fact, they gave rise to delicately
contrived legal questions. Namely, the idea had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
suggested itself that the devil was able not only
to call forth promiscuous love between men and
women, but that sometimes he derived a particular
enjoyment if he could manage to prevent
a marriage that had already been consummated
by rendering the husband impotent. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maleficium</i>
was the technical term for such an event, equally
saddening to husband as to wife, and the theologians,
philosophers, and jurists of the middle
ages have written the most learned commentaries
regarding the legal consequences of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impotentia
ex maleficio</i>. It was disputed whether or not
this form of impotence would constitute a legal
cause for dissolution of marriage which, after
all, was a divine institution; the reasons also
why God permitted the devil to play such a
reprehensible game were investigated in a most
serious and profound manner. Any one interested
in this question of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impotentia ex maleficio</i>
may read the most excellent description of this
subject by Hansen (Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="3">III.</abbr>).</p>

<p>This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impotentia ex maleficio</i>—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, one of the
most extravagant outgrowths of medical superstition—occasionally
also gave rise to scandalous
lawsuits. This was the case in the disgraceful
divorce suit which took place about the year 860
between King Lothaire <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr> and his spouse Teutberga.
Lothaire was said to have lost his procreative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
power completely, owing to infernal artifices
of his concubine, Waldrada. The reason why a
concubine should undertake such a step, which,
after all, was bound to discredit her title and
office in the eyes of her lover, is not quite evident.
However, at that period it was not difficult
to find an explanation for this remarkable
fact. It was stated, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, that Waldrada was
instigated to this act solely by jealousy and selfishness,
in order to divorce the king from his
consort. This first step once taken, the courtesan,
by removing the spells cast by her, would take
good care that the king should soon be delivered
from the odious condition of impotence. However,
Waldrada had reckoned without her host—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
in this case, without Hinkmar, Archbishop
of Rheims; for this latter gentleman, exceedingly
well versed in all matters ecclesiastic,
politic, and diabolic, a genuine clerical fighting-cock,
very soon closely investigated the impotence
of his royal master. In an extensive
memorial he considered the royal impotence
according to its legal, theologic, philosophic,
moral, and various other aspects. Medical superstition,
accordingly, had acquired such power
that the sovereign of the holy Roman and German
empires had to submit his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas in venere</i>
to the test of public discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>But conditions were to become much worse.
When, about the thirteenth century, scholasticism
had usurped full control of human reason,
and all sciences were permitted to be pursued
only in a scholastic sense, medicine was entirely
divorced from the actual conditions of life. It
was completely detached from nature, its great
teacher, and irretrievably entangled in the subtleties
of an uncertain philosophy. Its activity
now depended exclusively upon the study of the
ancients—by no means, however, upon that study
in which an attempt was made to master the
intellectual spirit of ancient medicine, but which
consisted in a slavish adherence to the letter.
Every decision of the ancients, without any regard
to nature, was made a dogma, and he was
the best physician who was most familiar with
these dogmas, who understood best how to interpret
them most keenly. Mankind had entirely
lost the conception that the ancients had attained
worth and importance only in that they measured
things by the standard of unbiased experience,
and tested their conclusions according to
the phenomena of nature as described from accurate
observation of the sick.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that superstition met with
a well-prepared soil in a system of medicine that
was overburdened with dogmas and degraded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
into utter subserviency to a vainglorious philosophy.
The natural result was that the medical
art of a period of the middle ages, steeped in
scholasticism, was nothing but a chaos of the
most despicable superstition and folly. The
most shocking result of these conditions was the
belief in witches, and, with this, medical superstition
entered upon a new stage. Whereas until
then it had possessed a restricted, mere local
vitality, and entailed danger only upon those who,
from thoughtlessness, lent a willing ear to it, now
it degenerated into a mental epidemic which
threatened equally all classes of the people. The
unspeakable misery which this variety of medical
superstition has brought to the Western
world is well known, so that we may refrain from
entering into details, referring our readers to the
excellent work of Hansen on this subject.</p>

<p>Physico-medical thought was so thoroughly
destroyed by the above-described conditions that,
even when humanity commenced to shake off the
scholastic yoke, during the period of Renaissance,
medicine was only able, in part, to follow this
lead. Altho, under the inspiration of the ancients,
it returned to nature, it was not able to
rid itself of the superstitious idea of the continuous
interference of supernatural powers with
the performance of the most common functions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the body. The Church still persisted in the
implicit belief in such views, and still dominated
men’s minds so thoroughly that even many physicians,
who in other respects were entirely unbiased,
remained on this point dutiful children
of the Church; in fact, even those who were
fully aware of the shortcomings of the Christian
Church unhesitatingly adhered to the belief in
demons as developed from antique conceptions
by the Church Fathers. Thus, for instance, Dr.
Martin Luther was a strict believer in the doctrine
which taught men to hold the devil responsible
for the origin of all diseases. He thus
expressed himself, for instance: “No disease
comes from God, who is good and does good to
everybody; but it is brought on by the devil,
who causes and performs all mischief, who interferes
with all play and all arts, who brings into
existence pestilence, Frenchmen, fever, etc.”
He accordingly believed that he himself was
compelled to scuffle with the devil when his
physical condition was out of order. Thus, when
suffering from violent headache, he wrote to the
Elector, John of Saxony: “My head is still
slightly subject to him who is the enemy of
health and of all that is good; he sometimes
rides through my brain, so that I am not able to
read or to write,” and upon another occasion he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
said, in regard to his health: “I believe that my
diseases are by no means due to natural causes,
but that ‘Younker Satan’ plays his pranks with
me by sorcery.”</p>

<p>The devil was also held responsible for the appearance
of monsters; it was believed that the
ruler of hell helped young girls against their will
to enjoy the delights of motherhood. However,
these delights were said to be of a peculiar kind,
in that intercourse with the devil was always
bound to be followed by the birth of the most
frightful monsters. The devil then unloaded these
most remarkable monsters into respectable people’s
houses. Even Luther was not able to free
himself from this most astonishing delusion. On
the contrary, he was devoted to it with such conviction
that, when once in Dessau, he heard of a
monster (according to medical opinion, it was a
question of a rhachitic child) that had grown to
be twelve years of age, he advised, in all seriousness,
that this sinful product of devilish intercourse
be thrown into the river Mulde (compare
Möhsen, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 506, etc., on “The
Relations of Luther to the Devil”).</p>

<p>If it was very improper of the devil to visit
even clerical gentlemen, he crowned his wickedness,
in that he very unceremoniously honored
even ministers in the pulpit with his visit. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
an occurrence took place in Friedeberg, Neumark,
in 1593, in which otherwise harmless town
the devil commenced suddenly to create an unheard-of
commotion. He harassed about one
hundred and fifty people, and even in church he
gave so little rest to those he possessed, that they
raised various kinds of mischief in this holy
place. When, thereupon, the preacher, Heinrich
Lemrich, thundered against these deviltries
from the pulpit, the devil became so incensed
that immediately he promenaded into the Reverend
Lemrich himself, so that the good minister
raged in the pulpit exactly as did the members
of his congregation down below in the nave.</p>

<p>However, this variety of medical superstition
finally spread to such an extent that, as medical
aid was powerless against the devil, the aid of
God, by order of the consistory, was invoked
from all pulpits of the Margravate against the
above-described misdeeds of hell’s ruler.</p>

<p>But the clergy adopted still another plan to
checkmate the devil. In various publications
they enumerated the villainies which Satan might
visit on mankind, so that each and every one
would be enabled to protect himself against the
aggressions of the devil, in whatever form he
might make his appearance. The first publication
of this character was issued in 1555 by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
General Superintendent of the Electorate of
Brandenburg, Professor of the University of
Frankfort, Herr Musculus; it bore the very appropriate
title, <cite>The Pantaloon Devil</cite>. In fact, as
early as 1575 a compilation was published in
Frankfort-on-the-Main, in which twenty-four
different forms, which the devil might assume
in visiting humanity, were discussed most conscientiously
and with becoming diffuseness of
style (compare Möhsen, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 426, etc.).</p>

<p>From that time it was impossible for mankind
to shake off the belief in devil and demons. The
thought of being possessed played a conspicuous
part even in the first half of the nineteenth century,
thanks to the activity of Justinus Kerner,
and even medicine felt called upon to busy itself
more thoroughly with this newly resurrected belief.
This was done, for instance, by Dr. Klencke,
who, in 1840, published a little book exclusively
for the purpose of disproving the existence of
spirits.</p>

<p>We have so far shown the potent influence exerted
upon medical superstition by antique as
well as by medieval philosophy. But the newer
philosophy greatly influenced the destiny of medicine,
even at the end of the eighteenth and at
the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. The
natural philosophy based upon the doctrines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Schelling once more submerged the art of healing
in mysticism, and thus necessarily abetted
superstition. The physician no longer conceived
disease as the effect of disturbances in the life of
the bodily organs, but held various forms of inconceivable
powers responsible for the incidence
of a malady. The soul wrapped in sin had power
to lead the life of the body from the normal into
the pathological condition, and, accordingly,
prayer and the belief in Christian dogmas again
became active as curative factors. It was especially
the Munich clinician, Nepomuk von Ringseis,
who placed such theories before his pupils,
and who, in his “System of Medicine,” published
in 1840, made them generally known.
Ringseis states in this book: “As disease is originally
the consequence of sin, it is, altho not
always indispensable, yet according to experience,
incomparably more safe that physician as
well as patient should obtain absolution before
any attempt at healing be made.” Another passage
reads: “Christ is the all-restorer, and as
such He cooperates in every corporeal cure.” In
this sense Ringseis calls the sacraments “the
talismans coming from the Physician of all physicians,
and, therefore, the most excellent of all
physical, stimulating, and alterative remedies.”</p>

<p>Thus, after almost three thousand years, medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had returned to the stage at which it originated—namely,
to the view that incorporeal, supernatural
factors were to play a determining part
in pathology and therapy. However, that there
are plenty of individuals even in our time who
are at any moment ready again to sacrifice wantonly
all enlightenment and all progress to this
varied superstition, is demonstrated by the cases
of Mrs. Eddy and the Reverend Dowie, those
modern representatives of medical superstition.
There is only one protection against these relapses,
against these atavistic tendencies, and
that is education in natural science. The more
it becomes disseminated among the people the
less danger there will be that the heresies of a
false philosophy, or of an overheated religious
sentiment, may again conjure up medical superstition
to the detriment of humanity.</p>

<p class="st1">THE RELATIONS OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO
MEDICAL SUPERSTITION</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> point of view from which man has regarded
nature for thousands of years up to modern times
has been such as to promote most effectually the
development of superstition; for the idea that
a satisfactory insight into the character of natural
phenomena can be obtained only by means
of adequate experiments, and of observation perfected
by the employment of the inductive
reasoning and ingenious instruments, is comparatively
recent. Natural science applying such
means is scarcely two hundred years old. Fit
instruments for the observation of nature existed
only to a limited extent up to the eighteenth century,
and, besides, their complete efficiency left
much to be desired. The attempts to wrest from
Nature her secrets by means of experiment were
but feeble and unsuccessful. Altho the ancients,
as is shown by the writings of Hippocrates,
Galen, and others, had some knowledge of vivisection,
they had practised it to a most limited
extent. During the middle ages and the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the Renaissance comparatively few physical
experiments were made. Whatever researches
in natural science were then undertaken were
intended much less for the investigation of nature
than for fantastic and superstitious purposes—as,
for instance, the investigations of alchemy
and astrology.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that, under such circumstances,
a number of superficial, imperfect, and
distorted observations crept into the theoretic
system of natural science.</p>

<p>However, this was not all; the diagnostico-theoretical
method, by means of which antiquity,
the middle ages, and even the greatest part of
more modern times, had seen the natural sciences
treated, was radically wrong. Man did not feel
his way carefully from experiment to experiment,
from observation to observation, until the
general principle was found which inductively
comprised a number of phenomena under one
uniform principle of law, but the principle which
was at the bottom of phenomena was fixed upon
a speculative basis, and in accordance with this
principle the phenomena were interpreted—as
was done, for instance, in medicine in the case
of humoral pathology. And as this speculatively
constructed principle was obtained exclusively
by a method dangerous to the cognition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
natural sciences, by conclusion from analogy,
naturally the most fantastic and adventurous
conceptions soon became accepted in the realm
of natural philosophy. But natural philosophy
once lost in such a labyrinth, an aberration of
the perceptive powers can not fail to follow—at
least, in certain domains of nature. As a matter
of fact, this fallacious perception promptly made
its appearance, and has proved the stumbling-block
of science from its earliest days up to the
present times. Occultism, mysticism, or whatever
the names may be of the various forms of
superstition, have sprung from these erroneous
conceptions of natural science. It may even be
contended that no variety of superstition exists
which is not somehow connected with a distorted
observation or explanation of nature. However
interesting these considerations may be, we can
not here pursue them any further.</p>

<p>Such investigations belong to the history of
superstition in general, and any one who desires
more detailed information is referred to the
enormous literature of the subject. We can
here consider only those relations which prevail,
or have prevailed, between superstition and natural
science, and principally the influence which
was thus exerted upon the art of healing by
astronomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Astronomy and medicine became most intimately
connected during the earliest periods of
human civilization. The literature of cuneiform
inscriptions shows us that the attempt to bring
the stars into connection with human destinies
is primeval, and reaches back to the ancient
Babylonian age, even to the Sumero-Accadic
period (Sudhoff, <cite>Med. Woche.</cite> 1901, No. 41).
How primeval peoples came to connect their
destinies with the heavenly bodies and their
orbits is explained so lucidly by Troels-Lund
(page 28, etc.) that we shall cite his descriptions,
even if they are rather long for quotation.
He says: “The Chaldean history of creation is
inscribed upon seven clay tablets. On the fifth
tablet we read: ‘The seventh day He instituted
as a holy day, and ordained that man should
rest from all labor.’ Why just seven? Because
the holy number seven of the planets imperceptibly
shone through the work of creation, and was
imperceptibly impressed upon the entire order
of thought. We are here at the decisive epoch at
which the planets for the first time gave an impetus
to human conception, the effects of which
were to persist for thousands of years. This was
repeated a second time when Copernicus, in dealing
especially with the orbit of the planets, founded
the still-prevailing conception of the universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the theory of creation could be reconciled
with the phenomenon of sun and moon moving
in their regular courses. They were in this
case no longer, as had been assumed until then,
individual living beings and divinities, but
lights kindled by a mighty God, and intended
to move day and night, in an established order,
under the dome of heaven. But the other five
planets! It was unnecessary to be a Chaldean
on the Babylonian Tower in order to feel amazement
at these. Every one who had ever followed
with his eye their courses for a few nights during
a caravan journey, every one who, lying awake,
had occasionally attempted to read the time from
the only clock of the night—the star-covered
canopy of heaven—was bound to have noticed
their peculiarities as to light and course. They
did not shine uniformly, but sometimes intensely,
at other times faintly, and entirely different was
their radiance from that of other stars—reddish,
greenish, bluish. And their course was at one
time rapid, at other times slow; then backward
or oblique; sometimes they disappeared entirely.
Necessarily they appeared inexplicable not only
to the inexperienced observer, but to a still
higher grade of intellect—that of the most experienced
Chaldean; for, altho their periods
could possibly be calculated, their courses beggared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
all geometrical figures. These confused
paths could be explained only in one manner—namely,
as the expression of an arbitrary will,
the manifestations of an independent life. The
courses of the planets furnished the astronomic
proof that the heavenly bodies were animated.
The universe was more than created, it was godhead
itself in living activity.</p>

<p>“How this point of view broadened and
cleared everything! The world assumed the
shape of an enormous hall upon which divine
power, divine will, continuously acted from
above. Farthest down was the world of the elements.
In boundless distances above it moved
the moon and the six other planets, each one in
its transparent heaven. In the highest height,
finally, revolved the canopy of impervious
heaven, into which constellations were ranged
in shapes that resembled animals (Tablet <abbr class="ni" title="5">V.</abbr>,
verse 2). Apparently these rotations did not
have anything in common with each other; a
power which passed through them from above
moved these elemental worlds. Did not daily
experience of their rising determine winter,
storm, drought, etc.? Thus the processes on
earth only reflected and repeated the course of
these divine and heavenly bodies; yea, divine
will itself. But their order of movement varied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Sun and moon with their regular courses spin,
as it were, the firm warps and woofs; the other
five are instrumental in producing what is
changeable and apparently accidental. Unitedly
in their course through heaven the seven
weave the threads of fate. Silently they weave
the design of terrestrial life. Upon them depend
not only summer and winter, rain and drought,
but also the life and death of every living being;
as determined by the constellation of their birth,
such is each man, so will he live. Never do the
heavenly bodies repeat precisely the same relative
positions, and, therefore, never are two
years, two days, two human beings, two leaves,
completely identical.”</p>

<p>So far Troels-Lund.</p>

<p>Much as we agree with what Troels-Lund says,
yet we believe that the decisive motive which
led humanity to bring their bodily welfare into
closest connection with the starry canopy of
heaven was suggested by the powerful influence
which the sun exerts upon the bodily welfare of
all life. As this life-giving power of the sun had
a conspicuous share in the origin of primeval
sabianism, so also it exerted a similar influence
upon the development of astrology; for it must
have been obvious to even the most stupid observer
that his well-being depended to a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
extent upon the action of the sun. From this
perception to the idea that other heavenly bodies
were also intended to exert a decisive influence
upon things terrestrial was only a short step for
the ancient civilized peoples; for here the conclusion
from analogy was actually so closely and
so enticingly under every one’s nose that all he
had to do was but to pitch upon the powers
which rule all earthly life and neatly box them
up in a well-constructed system. But as the
conclusion from analogy was always considered
in the ancient world as the most certain,
never-failing path to knowledge, it was readily
followed in this connection also. And thus
astrology, like the greater part of medico-physical
knowledge, was based, we think, upon the
treacherous ground of a conclusion <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per analogiam</i>.</p>

<p>Besides, our opinion that the warming and
vitalizing power of the sun formed one of the
most important factors in the origin of astrology
is confirmed by the utterances of astrologists
themselves. Thus, for instance, Ptolemy points
to the sun and moon as the sources of life to
mankind, and Hermes and Almansor repeat the
dictum. This is furthermore proved by the unparalleled
popularity which astrology has enjoyed
in all phases of civilization. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
civilized people, either of ancient or of modern
times, which has not adhered to astrologic doctrines
with the fullest confidence and most unswerving
faith. Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks,
Romans, Germans, Romanians—in short, all
nations—have professed their belief in astrology.
Such a conformity of opinion would, however,
be inexplicable amid such a dissimilarity of
religious and cultural ideas as characterized the
different peoples, unless a common principle had
decisively influenced all nations in the same
manner. This principle was acknowledged in
the influence of the sun. Every human being
was bound to observe the animating power of the
sun on his own bodily sense and from his own
observation, and would be at once led to the
conclusion that a similar power resided also in
the other celestial bodies.</p>

<p>This conception, which to a great extent was
brought about by conclusions from analogy, provided
a method of inference concerning various
other phenomena. Man meditated, speculated,
concluded, until the required sidereal relation of
each organ and each function of the human body
was determined. Thus astrology may serve as
one of the most telling examples of scientific
delusions to which the ancient diagnostico-theoretical
methods were bound to lead, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
their conclusions from analogy and their deductive
modes of procedure.</p>

<p>The above survey indicates, altho only in very
general outlines, the origin of astrology. We
shall now consider more in detail the acquisition
for which the art of medicine is especially
indebted to astrology.</p>

<p>Babylonico-Assyrian civilization possessed in
its earliest ages a well-developed system of
astrologic medicine, as is evident from writings
bequeathed to us from antiquity. Campbell-Thompson
has recently published, from the great
stock of cuneiform tablets in the collection of the
British Museum, 276 inscriptions of an astrological
nature belonging to the so-called Kouyunjik
collection. Sudhoff has compiled them, so far
as they refer to medicine, and has subjected
them to critical analysis. We take the liberty
of repeating certain extracts from these cuneiform
tablets, which appear to be the reports
which Assyrian and Babylonian court astrologists
made to the king.</p>

<p>Tablet 69<i>a</i> says: “If the wind comes from the
west upon appearance of the moon, disease will
prevail during this month.”</p>

<p>Tablet 207: “If Venus approaches the constellation
of Cancer, obedience and prosperity will
be in the land ... the sick of the land will recover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Pregnant women will carry their confinements
to a favorable termination.”</p>

<p>Tablet 163: “If Mercury rises on the fifteenth
day of the month, there will be many deaths. If
the constellation of Cancer becomes obscured, a
fatal demon will possess the land and many
deaths will occur.”</p>

<p>Tablet 232: “If Mercury comes in conjunction
with Mars, there will follow fatalities among
horses.”</p>

<p>Tablet 175: “If a planet becomes pale in opposition
to the moon, or if it enters into conjunction
with it, many lions will die.”</p>

<p>Tablet 195: “If Mars and Jupiter come in
conjunction, many cattle will die.”</p>

<p>Tablet 117: “If the greater halo surrounds
the moon, ruin will be visited upon mankind.”</p>

<p>Tablet 269: “If an eclipse of the sun occurs
on the twenty-ninth day of the month of Jypar,
there will be many deaths on the first day.”</p>

<p>Tablet 271: “An eclipse at the morning
watch causes disease.... If an eclipse
takes place during the morning watch, and lasts
throughout the watch, while the wind blows
from the north, the sick in Akkad will recover.”</p>

<p>Tablet 79: “If a halo surrounds the moon and
if Regulus stands within, women will bear male
children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Tablet 94: “If sun and moon ... on
the fifteenth day ‘answer my prayer’ shall he
say ... Let him nestle close to his wife, she
shall conceive a son.”</p>

<p>These few extracts show us the close relations
into which Assyrico-Babylonian culture brought
the becoming and passing away of all animal life
with the stellar movement; in fact, as we note
from Tablet 94, the astrologists of this period did
not hesitate to intrude into the most intimate occurrences
of married life. It is quite obvious that,
under such circumstances, the Babylonian physician
was compelled to consider very carefully
the utterances of the astrologists in carrying on
his practise. It may be possible that we shall
obtain still further information regarding the
quality of sidereal therapy from the numerously
discovered cuneiform tablets. We know positively
that a physician was forbidden to perform
any surgical operations on certain days of each
month. Thus, for instance, the 7th, 14th, 19th,
21st, and 28th of the month Schall-Elul were
unfavorable days for such operations (Oefele).
These directions were especially stringent in regard
to venesection, to which act we shall again
refer in greater detail.</p>

<p>When civilization, later on, continued to
thrive upon the shores of the Nile, astrology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
still found a fertile soil there, and it appears
that here also the name <span title="Iatromathêmatikoi">Ἰατρομαθηματικοί</span> has
originated, which, subsequently, was a favorite
designation of adherents to the sidereal art of
healing. The astrological prognoses made by
the professional astrologist, Petosiris, for the king
Nechepso of Sais are well known. However, it
appears, according to the latest investigations
(compare the excellent work of Sudhoff, page 4,
etc.), that these prognoses have nothing at all to
do with that king Nechepso who reigned in the
seventh century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span> It seems more probable
that some cunning Alexandrian astrologist of the
second century, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, fraudulently used the name
of the king as a cover for his work. But however
this may be, these prognoses of Petosiris
have considerable value, in that they give us an
insight into the manufacture of such medical
prophesies.</p>

<p>The object of these prognoses was primarily to
discover the termination of a disease, whether
the patient would die or recover, either soon or
only after the lapse of a certain time—for instance,
after seven days. This was all that Petosiris
undertook to predict. All details regarding
treatment, complications, and diagnosis of a case
are still entirely wanting. Petosiris, in making
such a prognosis, by no means relied solely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the conjunction of certain celestial bodies, but
he employed a rather intricate method, in which
mystic numbers, onomancy, and astrology were
important elements. To prognosticate medically
according to this system a circle of numerals was
required in the first place. There existed two
different kinds of such circles—one simple, the
other more complicated. Berthelot has furnished
us with examples of both as used by
Petosiris.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fig1"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p>FIG. 1—CIRCLE OF PETOSIRIS</p>

<p>(After Bouché-Leclercq, p. 539)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The more simple formula (Fig. 1) consisted of
two concentric circles, the smaller of which was
divided into four quadrants. Between both concentric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
circles and within the horizontal diameters
were inscribed the words: <span title="meon zoê">μέον ζωή</span>; to
the right of this: <span title="hê mikra zoê">ἡ μικρὰ ζωή</span>; to the left of the
vertical line: <span title="hê menalê zoê">ἡ μεναλη ζωή</span>. Under the vertical
line was inscribed: <span title="mesos thanatos">μέσος θάνατος</span>; to the right of
this: <span title="mikros thanatos">μικρὸς θάνατος</span>; and to the left of the vertical
line: <span title="ho menas thanatos">ὁ μένας θάνατος</span>. Only words which
point to the longer or shorter duration of life, or
to the death-struggle, were therefore employed.
The four quadrants of the enclosed circle, as well
as the vertical diameter, contained the numerals
from 1 to 29 in a mystical order, representing
the duration of the moon’s phases. The above
(Fig. 1) shows us this astrological circle of
Petosiris.</p>

<p>The second—essentially more complicated—formula
consists of three concentric circles. Various
words are inscribed between the first and
second circles, as in Fig. 1. Between the second
and third circles, and in the verticals, the
numerals from 1 to 30 are disposed in a mystical
arrangement. Furthermore, these circles are
not, as in Fig. 1, divided into four quadrants,
but into eight equal sections. At these points in
which the radii forming the sectors intersect the
periphery of the outermost of the three concentric
circles, arched enclosures are raised which
also contain various words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fig2"></a>

<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 2—CIRCLE OF PETOSIRIS</p>

<p>(After Bouché-Leclercq, p. 540)</p></div>
</div>

<p>When it was sought, by means of the above-described
figures, to determine the medical future
or the life and death of an individual, this
could be accomplished with the aid of the diagram
represented in Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a> in such a manner
that the duration of the disease in days, the
numerical value of the name of the patient, and
the phases of the moon were added, and the sum
divided by 29. The result thus obtained was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
interpreted by referring to the diagram. If this
figure happened to be, for instance, in the right
upper quadrant, the patient, altho he would
recover from his illness, would live only for a
very short period; if this number was found in
the vertical line, below the horizontal diameter,
the patient was destined to die after a short
struggle.</p>

<p>Much more intricate was the use of the astrological
apparatus illustrated in Fig 2. Here
the number of the moon’s day, and the numerical
values of the name of the patient were not added,
but each of these figures was separately looked
for in the diagram. If the moon figure was
found in the lower, the figure for the name in
the upper, ends of the verticals—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, where
<span title="dusis hupogeios">δυσις ὑπόγειος</span>, setting, and <span title="anatolê hupergeios">ἀνατολὴ ὑπέργειος</span>,
rising, stand—the individual concerned, altho in
danger, finally recovered. If, on the other hand,
the moon figure was discovered in the upper,
and the figure for the name in the lower, ends
of the verticals, nothing but evil was in store for
the questioner, but the misfortune appeared
under the guise of fortune. If both numbers,
however, were at the upper ends of the verticals,
the prospects were favorable, but bad if both
figures occurred below the horizontal line.</p>

<p>A method which is similar to the simple apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of Petosiris is revealed to us in the so-called
<span title="ophaira Dêmokritou">οφαῖρα Δημοκρίτου</span>. It is contained in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papyrus Magica Musei Lugdunensis Batavia</i>, published
by Dietrich. Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a> shows the illustration
belonging to this
method, and also the
Greek directions for use,
as given in the papyrus.
It will be noticed that
in the method of Democritus
recourse is made
to a table of numerals
divided by a cross-line
into the upper and
larger, and a lower and
smaller, section. The
upper part contains in
three vertical columns
18, in the lower, 12 figures. To use the table,
the day when the disease began, the numerical
value of the name, and the days of the moon
were added, and the sum thus obtained divided
by 30. This quotient was then looked for in the
table of numbers. If it was found above the
cross-line, the patient recovered; if below, he
succumbed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fig3"></a>
<a href="images/fig3-hi.png"><img src="images/fig3.png" width="174" height="217" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 3—THE TABLE OF
DEMOCRITUS</p></div>
</div>

<p>There existed a great many other methods
besides those described above; for instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
system of the 12 places, the circle of Manilius,
the method of the mysterious Hermes Trismegistus,
the circle of Ptolemy, etc. However,
we can not here enter into a more detailed description
of these forms, and refer those that
wish more exhaustive information to Berthelot,
and, above all, to Bouché-Leclercq. Astrology,
and, with it, sidereal medicine, subsequently
traveled from its Oriental home into all civilized
countries of the then known world.</p>

<p>As regards Greek and Roman antiquity, astrology
in all its forms won a high reputation both
in Greece and Italy. Even the most eminent
ancient physicians, altho they did not unreservedly
adopt sidereal medicine, refrained from
disavowing it. Thus we find in the Corpus
Hippocraticum, the chief work of early Greek
medicine, passages which betray more than a
friendly feeling toward the astral art of healing.
It is true, expressions are not wanting which
sound like a direct disowning of astrology.</p>

<p>Let us consider for a few moments the attitude
of Hippocratic medicine toward astrology.</p>

<p>As to the rejection of astrologic medicine by
the followers of Hippocrates, we read (“Ancient
Medicine,” Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>; in the translation of
Fuchs, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, page 19): “For this reason I believe
that it [medical art] requires no basis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
vain presumption, such as the existence of invisible
and doubtful factors, the discussion of
which, if it should be attempted, necessitates a
hypothetic science of supernatural or of subterrestrial
nature; for, if any one should contend
that he knew anything about such a matter,
neither he, the lecturer, nor his hearers would
clearly understand whether his statements were
true or not, because nothing exists to which reference
could be had for purposes of verification.”</p>

<p>This surely is a refutation as definite as can
be desired of a medicine which depends upon
witchcraft or astrologic vagaries. However, various
other passages of the Corpus Hippocraticum
take an exactly contrary position. For example,
we find the following statement (on “Air,
Water, and Locality,” Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="17">XVII.</abbr>, in the
translation of Fuchs, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, page 390): “Attention
must be paid to the rise of the stars,
especially to that of Sirius,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as well as to the rise
of Arcturus, and, further, to the setting of the
Pleiades, for most diseases reach a crisis during
such periods, some of them abating in these
days, others ceasing entirely, or developing into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
other symptoms and different conditions.” These
words indicate a distinct intention of bringing
prognosis and course of diseases into the closest
relations with the motions of the celestial bodies.
In the second chapter of the same book similar
expressions occur: “He who knows how the
change of seasons and the rising and setting of
stars take place will also be able to foresee
how the year is going to be. Therefore, any one
who investigates these subjects and predicts
coming events will be thoroughly informed as
to each detail of the future; he will enjoy the
best of health, and take as much as possible the
right road in art. However, if any one should
be of the opinion that these questions belong
solely in the realm of astronomy, he will soon
change his opinion as he learns that astronomy
is not of slight, but of a very essential, importance
in medical art.” Stars and diseases are
also brought into mutual relations in the letter
to King Ptolemy (Emerins, page 293).</p>

<p>The above quotations refer exclusively to the
course of diseases in relation to the stars, but
we find in other passages also distinct references
are made to therapeutic methods; for instance,
in “Aphorisms,” § 4, paragraph 5, we read:
“Purging is very difficult during or before the
dog-days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It would, indeed, be most remarkable if no astrologic
remarks of any kind were found in the
Corpus Hippocraticum, as the idea of close relation
between the celestial bodies and matters
terrestrial had common currency during the Hippocratic
period. The songs of Stesichorus and
of Pindar show, for instance (as is also stated by
Pliny, Book 3, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="12">XII.</abbr>, Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, page 118),
that eclipses of certain stars were considered to
be pregnant with mischief. This superstitious
conception has, in some cases, actually caused
severe general calamities. Thus, for instance,
the Sicilian campaign ended unfortunately for
the Athenians only because their general, Nicias,
under a superstitious apprehension concerning
an eclipse, failed to put to sea. And as this campaign
was the cause to Athens of a partial loss
of Greek hegemony, we may safely say that astrology
had a decisive share in the fall of Athens
(Pliny, Book 2, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="23">XXIII.</abbr>).</p>

<p>The appearance of comets, like eclipses of the
sun and the moon, were also reputed to be ominous
among the ancients. Comets were considered
heavenly mischief-makers of the worst kind,
and almost every sort of calamity was ascribed
to them. A calamity was supposed to assume
various aspects, according to the position and
form of the comet. Under some circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
however, they were said to prognosticate many
events advantageous to mankind (Pliny, Book 2,
Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="24">XXIV.</abbr>). Thus Augustus considered a
comet, which was seen for an entire week at the
northern quarter of the heavens at the onset of
his rule, during performances which were given
in honor of Venus genetrix, to be his lucky star.</p>

<p>However, not only such extraordinary appearances
in the sky as comets, eclipses of the sun
and the moon, played a conspicuous part in
medical superstitions of the ancients. Even
those celestial phenomena which occur with a
regularity fixed by natural law, such as the revolution
of the sun and the moon, were considered
highly important events in therapeutic art.
Thus, affections of the eye in man and beast
were said to increase and to decrease with the
moon (Pliny, Book 2, Chapter <abbr class="ni" title="41">XLI.</abbr>).</p>

<p>All acute diseases were believed to be controlled
by the moon, whereas chronic affections
were thought to be under the influence of the
sun. In fact, everything that happened to man
was brought in immediate relationship with appearances
in the canopy of heaven. Thus, for
instance, it is stated by Marcus Manilius, the
well-known author of an astronomical didactic
poem dedicated to the Emperor Augustus:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<span class="i0">“Omnis cum coelo fortunæ pendeat ordo.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>In the thirteenth chapter of the second book
the poet maintains that each part of the human
body is subordinate to a distinct sign of the
zodiac. Thus, for instance, the head to Aries,
etc.</p>

<p>Altho the further development of Occidental
as well as Oriental astrology drew its resources
from the primeval Assyrian, Babylonian, and
Egyptian doctrines, yet from the second century,
<span class="f8">A.D.</span>, the astronomic work of Ptolemy and the
exhaustive description of antique medicine by
Galen derive their inspiration from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina
Astrologica</i>. Whatever these two great masters
were able to report of the dependence of the
functions of the body upon celestial bodies was
from then on, without further inspection and
examination, acknowledged to be true by the
great majority of physicians. Only occasionally
this or that practitioner is bold enough to oppose
the intrusion of astrologic vagaries into the art
of healing; among these radicals was the philosophically
trained physician, Sextus Empiricus,
who lived about the year 193, <span class="f8">A.D.</span> However,
this protest of brave Sextus, as well as all subsequent
ones, scarcely had any influence upon
the astrological development of medicine. Astrology
could not be arrested on its road to the
domination of the world, and until the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
century it controlled the thought of physicians
with the same invincible sway that it
exercised over the mental life of all other professions
and classes. Medico-astrological superstition
had become legalized, and this in spite of the
fact that Galen himself at last expressed his distrust
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i>, and at least
endeavored to extenuate his part in its dissemination.</p>

<p>Let us now scrutinize more minutely the condition
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i> in the second
century, <span class="f8">A.D.</span> The works of Ptolemy, the “Iatromathematica”
of the mysterious Hermes Trismegistus,
and the third book of Galen’s writing on
the “critical days” furnish sufficient material
for outlining the medico-astrological system of
that period.</p>

<p>In the first place, the method by which the
authors of that period instilled their astrologic
dotage into the minds of their contemporaries
varied considerably. Either astrological
remarks were here and there interspersed in a
work on medical or on astronomical subjects, as
was the case, for instance, in the “Opus Quadripartitum”
of Ptolemy and also in Galen’s book on
the “critical days,” or astrology was treated as
a special science in the form of a connected system,
as is done, for instance, in the “Iatromathematica”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of Hermes Trismegistus. Such textbooks
of astrology obtained publicity in large
numbers from about the fourteenth century on.
Whoever may be inclined to cast a glance into the
learned work of Sudhoff will be astonished to
observe the extent to which iathromathematics
flourished in the second half of the middle ages
and at the turning-point of the Renaissance. Still
another form was to impart to the public their astrological
doctrines in the form of short sentences.
We find nothing in such works regarding the
intricate calculations and methods by which endeavors
were made to fathom the language of
the stars, but astrological results were communicated
in concise, aphoristic sentences. This was
done in the “Centiloquium” of Ptolemy, a work
which in a hundred brief sayings brings an
epitome of astrological wisdom to market. The
work enjoyed the highest esteem in the middle
ages. Such a book, therefore, would correspond
to that form of modern literary production,
which, under the title “Method of acquiring
this or that accomplishment within a short period,”
is advertised to us modern people in the
daily press. Moreover, the “Centiloquium” of
Ptolemy had many imitators. Such a work is
found, for instance, in Arabic literature, and
contains astrologic wisdom condensed into 150<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
brief sentences by the astrologer Almansor, who
furnished the handbook upon request of his
ruler; the Arabian, Bethem, has produced a
similar work. We find analogous works appearing
later in the middle ages. Eventually, the
doctrines of astrology were put into neat rhymes;
thus, for instance, Heinrich von Rantzau, who
departed this life 1598 as governor of Schleswig-Holstein,
celebrates in 100 well-turned verses
the significance of the planets in relation to the
physical and mental welfare of humanity. We
shall again refer to this subject when considering
astrology of the middle ages. The iatromathematic
passages in the above-mentioned writings
of Ptolemy, Hermes, and Galen furnished
the foundation for all later astrologico-medical
theories. For what the middle ages believed
regarding the medical importance of the sidereal
world, especially of the planets and the zodiac,
was nothing but the immediate continuation, or
elaboration, of the astrologic teachings of Ptolemy
and other authors of the first Christian centuries.</p>

<p>In the first place, every portion of the human
frame was placed under the influence of a certain
celestial body.</p>

<p>The five planets already known to the ancients,
as well as sun and moon, governed, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to Hermes, the following parts of the
body:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun, the right eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon, the left eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saturn, hearing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jupiter, the brain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars, the blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus, taste and smell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercury, tongue and gullet.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>However, the influence which sun, moon, and
the planets exercised upon the human body
gradually became more intricate. It was no
longer satisfactory to enumerate relations between
the bodies of heaven and the human organs
of such a general nature as given by the above
table of Hermes. All parts and functions of
the body were to be brought into the closest relations
with the planets. Thus, for instance,
the celebrated humanist, Marsilius Ficinus, the
friend of the Medici (1433 to 1499), depicts
most minutely in a book “On Life,” which was
much read in its time, the relations between the
body and the planets. This was also done by
Heinrich von Rantzau, in his “Tractus Astrologicus,”
which in its time was very celebrated.
There we read regarding these conditions as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Saturn</span> governs the spleen, the bladder, the bones,
the teeth, and, in part, the circulating juices of
the body; causes the color of the skin of man to
be dark yellowish; impedes or promotes growth;
causes the eyes to be small, and prevents the
growth of the beard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jupiter</span> governs the lungs, the ribs, cartilages, the
liver, arteries, the pulse, and the development of
human semen; causes the white color of the skin,
and gives a good figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mars</span> governs the bile, kidneys, veins, and sexual
organs, and of these especially the testicles;
makes hair red and the temper irascible, and
inclined to outrages of various kinds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venus</span> governs the uterus, the breasts, the sexual
organs, the spermatic tubes, the loins, and the
buttocks; endows man with physical beauty, furnishes
him with long hair, round eyes, and a

part of this star that it presented mankind with
gonorrhea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mercury</span> governs all mental processes—memory,
imagination, the brain with its nerves, the hands,

<p><span class="smcap">The Sun</span> governs the brain, nerves, urine, the right

bladder, taste, the organs of reproduction,
the left eye of the male, the right eye of the
female, and the feminine liver, and the entire
left half of the body.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The signs of the zodiac, like the planets, exert
full control over the various parts of the body.
Honest Bartisch, of Königsbrück (1535 to 1606),
has given us in his “Eye-Service” an illustration
of these relations. Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a> is a reproduction
of this plate of Bartisch.</p>

<p>The sun, moon, planets, and zodiac regulated
not only the life of the various limbs of living man
placed under their special care, but their activity
commenced at that moment when the
foundation was just about to be laid for the future
bodily existence of a mortal—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, at the moment
of conception. If, during this critical process,
the respective bodies of the heavens were in an
unfortunate conjunction, the members of the
future being, the most primitive forms of which
had just been founded, were bound to suffer.
Naturally, however, only those parts of the body
were affected by this destiny which were in the
care of stars that happened to be in unpropitious
conjunction at the time.</p>

<p>If the act of conception had passed without
evil influence on those that were actively and
passively participating in it, the product of that
hour could by no means be sure that this or that
planet would not maliciously thwart the ease and
tranquillity of its embryonic and fetal life. For
sun, moon, and the seven planets each governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one month of intra-uterine life, as is explained
by Jacobus Forliviensis. Saturn reigns during
the first month of pregnancy, Jupiter in the
second, Mars in the third, the sun in the fourth,
Venus in the fifth, Mercury in the sixth, the moon
in the seventh; the eighth month is ruled again
by Saturn, and this latter planet now shows itself
to be so malicious that it immediately destroys
all life born in the eighth month. Jupiter again
takes control during the ninth month, and, as
this star is fond of warmth and humidity, and,
therefore, a friend of life in any form, no danger
is to be feared for a fetus entering the world
during this month. However, after the nine
months of pregnancy have passed without evil
interference by the planets, Mars once more is in
command, and his influence helps in accomplishing
a normal birth.</p>

<p>After the fetus had successfully passed all
dangers which the planets could cause during
the nine months of intra-uterine life, and after it
had successfully matured, the hour of birth
might, after all, be accompanied with other
quite severe sidereal complications. For if any
planet was in an unfavorable sign, or if the relations
between the signs of the zodiac and the sun
or the moon were not quite in their regular order,
those members which were presided over by the
respective stars were made to suffer. The correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
casting of the medical horoscope, therefore,
required the most accurate knowledge of the
minute of birth, with simultaneous occurrences
in the canopy of heaven. Provident fathers,
accordingly, were mindful of having an astrologer,
during the hour of birth, in the room in
which the confinement was to take place, so that
he might be able to ascertain as accurately as
possible the celestial occurrences which would
determine the bodily welfare of the new-born,
and to arrange them for the horoscope.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fig4"></a>
<a href="images/fig4-hi.png"><img src="images/fig4.png" width="381" height="535" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 4—THE RELATION OF THE PARTS OF THE HUMAN
BODY TO THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC</p></div>
</div>

<p>After the young mortal had safely arrived,
and if a fortunate destiny had placed in his cradle
a favorable medical horoscope, both for the hour
during which the first material foundation had
been laid for his life and also for the hour of his
birth, he had overcome only a small part of the
troubles which the starry world might be able to
inflict on his bodily welfare. If the various
signs of heaven appeared in unfavorable conjunction,
or if the moon entered into any fatal
relations with the signs of the zodiac, members
of the body which were under the influence of
the respective celestial bodies were still imperiled.
These dangers might threaten not only
one individual, but they were capable, eventually,
even of calling down epidemics and pestilence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
upon all humanity. After any form of
disease had taken hold of a person its course,
treatment, and termination could be clearly read
in the stars of heaven. It was necessary, above
all, to ascertain the day, hour, and minute when
the disease appeared. Unfortunately, this must
have been quite difficult at times; for many diseases
begin so insidiously that the moment of the
attack is completely beyond precise definition.
In such a case one did the best that could be
done, and probably took as the moment of attack
the first complaints of the patient regarding
his disorder. After the appearance of the disease
was dated in such a manner, the heavenly
body, in the ascendant at this period, was then
ascertained; thus, the position and the course
and the phases of the moon, the relations of sun
and moon to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and
the planets would be noted. It was necessary
to observe whether the moon was in opposition,
quadrature, or conjunction to the planets while
she stood in the sign of this or that figure of the
zodiac. From these observations clear conclusions
were first drawn regarding the general condition,
the character, the duration, and the
prognosis of the affection. These conclusions,
however, were by no means satisfactory as yet.
An attempt was therefore made to obtain a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
more detailed insight into the causes, complications,
and therapy of the case in question by
means of astrology, and such information was
abundantly provided in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place, the fact that sun, moon,
planets, and the signs of the zodiac shared the
rule over the various organs of the body, and
furnished positive intimations regarding the
cause of the disease in question, made it unnecessary
for the physician to trouble himself at
all with an examination of the patient in order to
ascertain cause and localization of the affection.
One glance at the conjunctions of the stars was
sufficient to show which organ of the patient happened
to be endangered by the celestial constellation.
If an individual complained, for instance,
of disturbed digestion, and if the heavenly body
that presided over the liver presented any remarkable
phenomena, naturally only the liver
was responsible for the case in question, and the
diagnosis was made. Complications were to be
expected if the stars which controlled the circulation
of blood and mucus showed unfavorable
signs. It was even possible for the physician
well versed in astrology to determine in advance
the period of time at which the occurrence of
such humoral complications might be expected,
as he had learned that the various hours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
day and of the night were to exert a powerful
influence upon the juices of the body. For instance,
Almanzor explains that the first three
hours of day and of night are in closest relation to
the blood, whereas the second quarters of day
and of night hold sway over the yellow, the
third over the black (bile), and the last quarters,
finally, over the mucus. However, not only were
the various hours of great importance to the
course of the disease, but certain days of the
disease—so-called critical days—were of still
greater significance. It is true, the doctrine of
these critical days was by no means the property
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i>, but the Corpus Hippocraticum
already contained a book <span title="Peri chriêsimôn">Περὶ χρίησὶμων</span>.
But the followers of Hippocrates had developed
this theory only from humoro-pathological premises,
and Galen, in his work <span title="chrêhisimai hêmerai">χρήἱσιμαι ἡμέραι</span>, had
only included astrology in order to explain and
to prove the entire doctrine of crises (compare
also Sudhoff). He calculated in accordance
with moon weeks and months, and in such a
manner that a week counted six days and seventeen
and one-half hours, and the month of the
moon only twenty-six days and twenty-two
hours. The seventh, fourteenth, twentieth,
and twenty-seventh days were to be considered
critical days of the first order. “Contemplate,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
says Galen, “the critical days in
the course of the moon in the angles of a geometrical
figure of sixteen sides; if you find
these angles in a favorable constellation, the patient
will fare well; badly, however, if evil signs
prevail.” But not only were certain hours and
certain days of the week said to exert an important
astrological influence upon the human body,
such an influence was ascribed also to certain
years. Such years were called “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anni Scansiles</i>”—that
is, “climacteric.” The expression “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anni
Climacterici</i>” was also used, but this designation
has nothing in common with the modern conception
of the climacteric. It was believed that
the condition of the body underwent a thorough
revolution during these climacteric years, and
that a new stage, as it were, of organic life was
reached. Heinrich von Rantzau, the astronomic
aristocrat and statesman, accordingly defines the
climacteric years as “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anni, in quibus ad sequentis
temporis constitutionem sese vertat ætas et inflectat</i>.”
Therefore, such years should in themselves harbor
dangers for corporeal existence, and offer no
favorable prospect for the course of diseases.</p>

<p>Two kinds of such climacteric years were distinguished.
One kind was brought about by
multiplication with the figure 7, and they were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anni hebdomatici</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">climacterici (stricte sic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
dicta)</i>. Accordingly, these were the years 7, 14,
21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63. These nine years
formed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">climactericus parvus</i>, whereas the years
77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126 were called the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">climactericus magnus</i>. A multiplication which
extended further, to 171, reached the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">climactericus
maximus</i>. The other kind of climacteric
years was obtained by multiplication with 9, and
such years were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anni enneatici</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decretorii</i>.
These were the years 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72,
81, 90, 99, 108, etc.</p>

<p>However, these climacteric years did not all
present the same dangers, but the peril inherent
in them varied considerably. It was determined
by the multiplicator, and here especially the 3
and the 7 played a very fatal rôle. The 21st
year of life (3 × 7), and the 27th (3 × 9), were
one grade higher in the scale of dangers than
those obtained by other multiplicators. Still
more dangerous were those years arrived at by
ascending in spaces of three hebdomads; therefore,
the 21st year of life—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the period of three
hebdomads—namely, 3 × 7; the 42d year, as a
period of 2 × 3 hebdomads—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, 2 × 21; the 63d
year of life, as a period of 3 hebdomads—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
3 × 21; 84 = to 4 × 21; 105 = 5 × 21, etc. The
49th year of life and the 56th year of life were
said to be still more dangerous than these years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
obtained from the period of three hebdomads.
It is true, the cause of the danger is quite obvious
in the case of the 49th year; it was the ominous
7 × 7 which here gave rise to forebodings. And
it was not quite comprehensible what caused the
bad reputation of innocent 56; Rantzau fails to
give us a sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>But the most dangerous climacteric year was
the 63d, for this was made up of 7 × 9. It was,
therefore, an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annus hebdomaticus</i> and, at the same
time, also an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annus enneaticus</i>, for it belonged
both to the class of those climacteric years which
were formed by the multiplier 7, as also to that
which were obtained by the multiplier 9. It was
most natural, therefore, that a period of life which
from two sides was fraught with danger, like the
unfortunate 63d year of life, was bound to appear
equally suspicious to the healthy and to the sick.
It is probable that this year was, therefore, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">androdas</i>, because, as Rantzau believes, it debilitates
and breaks vitality.</p>

<p>It would appear, moreover, that the climacteric
years enjoyed general consideration in ancient
times as well as in the middle ages, for
Rantzau names a number of celebrated men who
were said to have expressed themselves regarding
the significance of these years, such as Plato,
Censorinus, Gellius, Philo Judæus, Macrobius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Cicero, Boëtius, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ambrose, <abbr class="ni" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine,
Bede, Georgius Valla, and others. Not satisfied
with this statement, Rantzau also mentions in his
catalog a multitude of prominent men who all
departed this life in their 63d year, and thus, as
he believes, had established the dangerousness of
this year by their death.</p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that the 63d birthday
was celebrated with great apprehension during
the entire middle ages, and the respective individual
did not draw an easy breath until after
the ominous year had been successfully passed.</p>

<p>However, the stars knew not only how to tell
particulars regarding the probable course and
possible complications of diseases, but they also
gave information regarding very special forms of
affections. It was possible, thus, to learn from
them at what time diseases of the eye were to be
feared, when mental diseases were threatening,
when hemorrhages were to be expected, etc.
The astrologically trained physician was able
to obtain prompt information from the stars regarding
contingent surgical accidents; for there
existed various conjunctions of the celestial
bodies, according to Ptolemy, which surely
pointed to wounds, fractures of bones, burns,
concussions, and other lesions. In fact, it was
possible to see in advance, from the celestial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
phenomena, what limbs would be exposed to
forcible injury; thus, certain conjunctions of the
planets were said to prognosticate with certainty
wounds of the head; others, of the face; others,
again, of the hands and feet, of the fingers and
toes, of the arms and legs, of the trunk and
neck. Astrology, moreover, was not satisfied
with the prognostic and diagnostic activity which
we have just mentioned, but it also interfered in
therapy, internal as well as external.</p>

<p>Regarding, in the first place, internal medicinal
treatment, the astrologer knew how to give
positive information about the same; for all terrestrial
beings, of an organic as well as of an inorganic
nature, were under the influence of the
sun, the moon, of the planets, and of the signs of
the zodiac. The stars imparted certain powers
to the planets, to animals, and to all structures
of the inorganic world. If, therefore, it were
known what stars happened to appear in the
vault of heaven at the beginning of the disease
or of its treatment, it was only necessary seriously
to consider the organic and inorganic
structures under their supervision, and the
remedies required for a successful control of the
disease were presently at hand. But if the
healer wished to be absolutely certain what medicaments
to choose, the phases of the moon and
the condition of the sun were also to be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
into consideration. Some remedies could be administered
only when the moon was in a particular
relation to certain planets or stars of the
zodiac. These remedies were principally emetics
and purges.</p>

<p>Similarly to the internal clinician, so also in
surgery, the healer was entirely dependent upon
the conjunction of the stars. The primeval Babylonian
directed that the body must not be touched
with iron during certain conjunctions of the
stars, and this was also prescribed in all cases of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astrologica Medica</i>. It appears, however, that
this direction obtained less general surgical
recognition, but referred principally to blood-letting.
Even to this limited extent it implied
a high-handed interference with the art of the
ancient as well as of the medieval physician;
for venesection occupied an entirely different
position among therapeutic measures during that
period than it does to-day. Whereas modern
medicine does not consider blood-letting necessary,
except in the rarest cases, ancient as well
as medieval professors of medicine believed that
they could under no circumstances dispense with
it; in fact, it is probable that until the seventeenth
century there was scarcely any form of
disease the treatment of which would have been
possible without withdrawal of blood. An actual
system of blood-letting had been elaborated under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the influence of humoro-pathological opinions.
Every vein that could be reached with the lancet
was acted upon, and the school of medicine of
the period was punctiliously careful in teaching
which vessel presented the most suitable point
of attack for the hand of the physician in this
or that form of disease. The therapeutic subtleties
which were thus brought to light are
beyond description. Thus, a withdrawal of
blood from veins on the right side of the body
was said to yield an essentially different effect
from left-sided venesection, and each individual
vein of the body promised a special advantage
which was peculiar to this one vein. The physician
of that period surely had enough to do to
bear in mind all the numerous therapeutic effects
which he was to achieve by the opening of the
various veins. To facilitate this difficult art to a
certain degree special figures were designed—so-called
venesection manikins, in which the numerous
points for bleeding were most carefully
annotated. Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a> (page 175) shows such a picture.
It indicates no less than 53 different
localities for venesection, and as each and every
one of them again implied four or five, or possibly
even more, methods of blood-letting, we
may consider that there were many hundreds of
different possibilities for phlebotomy. If it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
easy to become lost in the labyrinth of this blood-thirsty
therapy, the difficulty of a methodical
application of venesection was very materially
increased by astrology; for astrology differentiated
between, first, favorable, then doubtful,
and, finally, unfavorable days for venesection,
basing this opinion upon certain positions between
sun, moon, and planets. Then the various
ages of life had also different days for venesection;
days, for instance, which promised to be
exceptionally successful for venesection in the
young, offered very unfavorable prospects to the
aged. Thus, for instance, the period from the
first quadrature of the moon to the opposition
was said to be excellent for bleeding in adolescence,
whereas this period was by no means inviting
for phlebotomy in those who had reached
the senile period. The chances for venesection
became rather intricate in their different aspects.
Thus, for instance, Stöffler taught:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>We see, therefore, that the physician of that
time was compelled to be well-versed in astronomy
unless he meant to commit grave mistakes
against the doctrines of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i>.
Such sins could eventually become rather dangerous
to the physician, for the code of Hammurabi
(about 2200, <span class="f8">B.C.</span>, ruler of Babylon) threatens
the operator, for not quite unobjectionable
surgical procedures, with the loss of his hands
(Winckler, page 33, § 218).</p>

<p>In order to satisfy the astrological requirement
of the physician most thoroughly, there
arose in the middle ages a very peculiar literature.
Under the name of an almanac or calendarium,
thick folio volumes appeared, which
enumerated, in long tables, the various positions
of the planets and of the signs of the zodiac, so
that the astrologer was enabled to note the fate
of mankind rapidly and easily. The contents of
such calendaria are beyond description. Apart
from remarks which referred to all occurrences
of civil life, was stated the exact period when to
have the hair cut, when venesection was to be
performed, when to draw teeth, when to take a
bath, etc. Even the proper time for prayer was
indicated by such a calendarium. According to
the experience of Peter of Abano, the conjunction
of the moon with Jupiter in the Dragon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sure to effect an answer to prayer. Hieronymus
Cardanus had discovered, with the aid of astrology,
that a request was sure to be complied with
if a prayer was offered to the Virgin Mary on
the first day of April, at 8 <span class="f8">A.M.</span> (Möhsen, Vol.
<abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 423). Physicians excelled in the compilation
of such calendaria, especially during the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Professors,
forensic physicians, surgeons—in fact, all representatives
of medical art—were equally intent
upon instructing the public by calendaria in regard
to the most various branches of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina
Astrologica</i>; thus, for instance, David Herliz,
physician at Prenzlau, supplied Pomerania,
Mecklenburg, and the Margravate of Brandenburg
with calendars for fifty years, from the year
1584. The Marburg professor of medicine, Victorinus
Schönfelder, played a similar rôle during
the same period for western Germany. The
physician, as almanac-maker, is probably one of
the most wonderful results of medical superstition,
and this aberration of medicine clung so
firmly to the people that, even in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, certain days of the
year were considered as especially favorable for
venesection, and the calendars took particular
pains to call the attention of the public most
emphatically to good days for blood-letting.</p>

<p>Such therapy, detached entirely from the
actual requirements of the case and based only
upon observation of the sky, was bound to be
attended with the most unfortunate results. The
suffering public was frequently but little cheered
by the assistance of its physicians, and often
felt the desire to find out what another physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
could do. It appears that such a condition
occurred quite frequently, for Ptolemy, in number
57 of his “Centiloquium,” gives special directions
under what astral conditions such a change
of physician could take place. He says: “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum
septimum locum atque ejus dominum in ægritudine
afflictum videris, medicum mutato.</i>” It appears
certain, accordingly, that a general change of
physicians was inaugurated by the public so
soon as the above conjunction was noted in the
sky.</p>

<p>Those who desired to be very careful in the
choice of their physician did not change only
when the conjunction of the stars recommended it
as advisable, but they also attempted to ascertain
the horoscope of the newly chosen medical adviser,
for medical wisdom was found in greatest
abundance in a man whose aspects showed a
certain form. “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perfectus medicus erit, cui Mars
et Venus fuerint in sexta</i>,” says Almansor.</p>

<p>This condition of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astrologia Medica</i> was such as
to weigh like an oppressive nightmare upon
mankind, not only for centuries but for thousands
of years, and in this way medical superstition
has slaughtered more human beings than
the most bloody wars ever did.</p>

<p>However, astrology has not always ruled our
kind with equal strength. There were periods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
during which belief in the fate-determining
power of the stars was more dominant, and others
in which it was feebler. The ancient world,
which was blindly devoted to all kinds of superstition,
had also cherished and fostered astrology.
But when the ancient theory of life was demolished
later on, and the Christian God of love had
taken possession of the world, the belief in the
fate-determining power of the stars was shaken,
and centuries, followed during which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina
Astrologica</i>, altho it did not by any means disappear
entirely, was forced more or less to the
rear. Astrology did not become resurrected
until scholasticism and dogmatism had held back
the activity of the mind from independent investigation,
thus bringing about the intellectual
darkness which for centuries prevailed. This
use of astrology truly forms one of the most
wonderful pages in the history of the development
of our race, for an actual <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furor astrologicus</i>
seized upon the world in the course of the thirteenth
century. The movement originated at
the court of Emperor Frederick <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr> The great
Ghibelline was so positive and so enthusiastic an
adherent of all astrologic doctrines that he did
not decide upon any undertaking until he had
first learned the opinion of the stars regarding
his enterprise. It was his firm belief that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
stars prophesied for him a political rôle which
was to shake the entire world, and of his astrological
prediction he apprised his adversary, the
pope, in the following words:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<span class="i0">Fata volunt, stellaeque docent, animumque volatus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quod Fridericus ego malleus orbis ero.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But if a ruler of high mental gifts is always
destined to exert a powerful influence upon his
epoch, how much more telling is this influence
when the contemporaries of such a monarch lead
a mental life, fettered by so many religious,
philosophical, and physical prejudices as undeniably
dominated mankind during the reign of
the great Hohenstaufen. If these conditions
were of the greatest advantage to astrology in
general, circumstances shaped themselves most
favorably for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i> in particular.
Very soon after the death of the star-learned
Hohenstaufen emperor, two highly talented
physicians bound themselves body and soul to
astrology—namely, Arnald Bachuone, called also,
after his birthplace, Villanueva, Arnaldus Villanovanus
or Arnald of Villanova (1235-1312),
and Petrus, called also, after his birthplace,
Abano near Padua, Petrus de Apono or Petrus
Aponensis (1250-1315). From that time until
the seventeenth century the most eminent representatives
of all the sciences and professions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
devoted themselves to the doctrines of astrology.
In the excellent work of Sudhoff is cited a notable
number of physicians—by no means the
most unskilful of their day—who confessed themselves
to be iatromathematicians (<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medici
astrologici</i>). Astrology, and with it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i>,
reigned supreme at most of the princely
courts from the thirteenth to the seventeenth
centuries. The Hohenstaufen, Frederick <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>,
was, as we have seen, an implicit adherent to
astrologic doctrines; likewise the Visconti in
Milan. The royal court of Aragon in Palermo
offered a sheltering asylum to astronomy and
to astrology. Alfonso <abbr class="ni" title="10">X.</abbr> of Castile was so enthusiastic
a friend of scientific astronomy that he
ordered the planet-tables of Ptolemy to be restored,
with an outlay of enormous costs, by fifty
astronomers called by him to Toledo. German
princes, such as Elector Joachim of Brandenburg,
Albrecht, Elector of Mayence, Landgrave
William of Hesse, Duke Albrecht of Prussia,
not only adhered to the predictions of the stars,
but they also subscribed to the statements of astrological
medicine. Thus, for instance, Thomas
Erastus (died 1583) the well-known opponent of
Paracelsus, tells us that, as body-physician to
the reigning count of Henneberg, he was not
permitted to begin a course of treatment until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
had consulted the stars. The German emperor,
Charles <abbr class="ni" title="5">V.</abbr>, was quite as constant a friend of the
astrologists; he was instructed in astrology by
his teacher, the subsequent pope, Hadrian <abbr class="ni" title="6">VI.</abbr>
The court of Denmark was the center of astrological
teachings under Frederick <abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, as no less a
personage than Tycho de Brahe was active there.
But not only rulers favored astrology, it met with
implicit belief from highly enlightened scholars,
statesmen, and naturalists. Thus, Melanchthon
was so convinced an adherent of all astrological
doctrines that he was incessantly active in their
favor by mouth and by pen. And when fatal
disease had finally seized upon him, he was soon
satisfied as to the issue, in that Mars and Saturn
happened to be in conjunction (Möhsen, Vol.
<abbr class="ni" title="2">II.</abbr>, page 416).</p>

<p>However, men were not wanting who courageously
took up the battle against astrological delusions.
Thus, for instance, the friend of Lorenzo
of Medici, the learned Count Pico of Mirandola
(1463-1494); also Girolamo Fracastori (1483-1553),
who is known by his didactic poem on
syphilis, opposed astrology.</p>

<p>If we now ask how it was possible that a superstition
like astrology could for centuries dominate
Occidental medicine, and was even able to
influence the best minds in its favor, an answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to this question will not be as difficult as might
appear at first glance. The very best and the
most enlightened minds are always particularly
affected by what is enigmatical and mysterious
in the phenomena of life. They perceive the
narrow limits set to our cognition of nature much
more acutely and deeply than the average
mind. This consciousness of the insufficiency of
our own knowledge, joined with an ardent desire
after a broadening of our understanding, tends
to turn the mind in strange directions. The
result of clearer self-knowledge in this modern
epoch of ours is an adverseness to any form of
romantic fancy, and is likely to end in a sad
resignation that may result in pessimism. But
the middle ages, with their exuberant confidence
and faith, their belief in wonders, and their
romantic ideas, did not suffer to any great extent
from scientific apathy. A sharply defined, mystic
tendency helped to overcome what was inadequate
in the cognition of nature. And for this
reason do we find this mystic tendency prominent,
especially in those representatives of that period
who, owing to their mental capacity, were bound
to perceive their defective insight into the manifestations
of life much more intensely than this
was felt by the average persons of narrower intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The conditions thus described, as well as the
diagnostico-theoretical principles on which medicine
and natural sciences were based in antiquity
and in the middle ages, until late in the eighteenth
century led many mentally gifted men
to consider astrology rather a refuge from the
current defective conception of natural phenomena
than a false doctrine.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p class="st1">INFLUENCE EXERTED UPON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF SUPERSTITION BY MEDICINE ITSELF</p>


<p><span class="smcap">As ancient</span>, medieval, and some more modern
theories of medicine have traveled over the same
diagnostico-theoretical roads as did the natural
science of those periods, they were naturally
subject to the same errors and aberrations. But
the consequences of their errors differed materially.
Whereas natural science, in the early
and middle ages, with its faulty diagnostico-theoretical
method, too frequently had recourse
to supernatural factors to explain terrestrial
phenomena, and thus created superstition instead
of elucidation, the pathology of ancient as well
as of medieval medicine avoided as much as possible
any recourse to miraculous agencies in
explaining the pathological phenomena of the
body. This it was forced to do for the sake of
self-preservation. For what would have become
of the physicians with their art, which was of a
purely material kind, working as it did with
drug and knife, if they themselves had traced
disease to supernatural causes? No one, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
such conditions, would have had any dealings
with mundane medical science. It is true, there
have been times when such a state of things
actually existed. The physician, with his earthly
appliances, was always led astray as soon as
metaphysical ideas had victoriously entered
pathology. History affords numerous examples
of this. The cult of relics, the belief in astrology
during half of the middle ages, show plainly to
what a degrading position the physician was
reduced as soon as a pathology reckoning with
earthly factors was replaced by a metaphysical
theory of disease. Then the physician was either
completely thrust aside—<span title="all' ôtheitai men exo nosountos ho iatros">ἀλλ’ ὠθεῖται μὲν ἒξω
νοσοῦντος ὁ ἰατρός</span>, as says Plutarch (“Superstition,”
Vol. <abbr class="ni" title="1">I.</abbr>, page 412)—or he was forced to
submit to a disgraceful interference. All schools
of medicine, therefore, from the humoral pathology
of the followers of Hippocrates to the so-called
parasitism of the nineteenth century, have
avoided as much as possible the acknowledgment
that supernatural influences were active as pathological
factors. Various as the principles of
the countless medical schools may have been,
they were all united in assuming as the starting-point
of their speculations some material process
of the body itself, in accordance with which they
applied their therapeutic agencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, it would seem as tho
medicine, under some circumstances, had recourse
to supernatural factors in explaining various
phenomena of physiological as well as pathological
conditions; as, for instance, in the primeval
pneuma-doctrine, or in those conceptions which
attribute to a mental or psychical principle a far-reaching
influence upon the performance of all
bodily functions. Upon closer investigation,
however, we shall find that the pneuma, or spirit,
the soul, or whatever else the mysterious mainspring
of all phenomena of life may be called,
was by no means conceived of by medicine as
immaterial or supernatural. On the contrary!
Medicine, as often as it required a spiritual something
to explain the manifestations of the body,
has always regarded this unknown quantity as
thoroughly substantial. It has not, indeed, been
possible to determine more precisely the material
nature of this great unknown, altho such attempts
are by no means wanting in Democritus,
Galen, and others; still it was always considered
a corporeal thing. Supernatural qualities were
ascribed to it only after death, but so long as the
soul animated the body, united with the latter,
it was a terrestrial being, and as such obeyed
the laws of terrestrial substance. It was possible
for medical science, therefore, to reckon with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in the explanation of pathological processes
without necessarily expecting a reproach that
supernatural agencies were called in for assistance.</p>

<p>Medicine, therefore, altho it has traveled the
same diagnostico-theoretical road as natural
science, has not, like the latter, directly produced
superstition. It is true, it has called forth
innumerable erroneous hypotheses. But a wrong
hypothesis, altho it may be nonsensical to the
utmost and give rise to the most serious practical
consequences, is by no means superstition; for
both error and superstition—so far as it is a
question of medical matters—are two radically
different conceptions, because the former concerns
itself only with natural, the latter with
supernatural factors.</p>

<p>Yet it is quite conceivable that the dissemination
of an intellectual principle can be furthered
and promoted without overt advocacy of
the principle itself, and this was the relation that
existed for thousands of years between medicine
and superstition; for we learn from this investigation
that the representatives of medicine were
too often ready to admit all kinds of superstitious
views into medicine. Whenever religion,
philosophy, and natural science have seriously
attempted to influence medicine in a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
promoting superstition, medical science yielded
to these attempts, and this is the only reproach
which can be justly laid at the door of our
science.</p>

<p>However, this reproach is mitigated if we
consider that medicine did not accord a home to
superstition of its own free will, or even from a
predilection for the heresies of other disciples,
but it did so under compulsion; for the religious,
the philosophical, the physical views which
forced the entrance of superstition into medical
science were almost always the views of a formidable
party. It is a fact sufficiently demonstrated
by history that powerful and far-reaching
predilections of the popular mind resistlessly
hurry along whatever is in their path. Such
mental currents are the products of their period;
they are the immediate result of the general
sentiment and feeling of their time, and for this
very reason they successfully overcome resistance.
The opinion of a single individual may raise a
protest against the spirit of the age, but this
resistance is always bound to be in vain. The
opinion of a single individual, even if it actually
represents the truth, is absolutely powerless to
resist the spirit of the age which, with elemental
force, compels obedience. Therefore, the courageous,
truth-seeking resistance which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
offered to the heresies of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Astrologica</i> by
Pico of Mirandola and Girolamo Fracastori was
bound to be futile, because astrology was a genuine
child of its time, and therefore held irresistible
sway over thought and sentiment.</p>

<p>If religion and philosophy so often interfered
with the development of medicine, this was only
possible because the general tendency of the contemporary
mind was thoroughly absorbed in this
or that religious or philosophical idea. For each
domain of human activity must needs be a mere
reflection of the tendency which guides the mind
of its period. This is a law which, with iron
force, dominates the development of culture.
Superstition in medicine, therefore, was bound
to flourish and thrive whenever it harmonized
with the spirit of the age.</p>

<p>This law, tho it may have checked the development
of our science, nevertheless holds out
the certain promise of a period, the intellectual
power of which will thoroughly clear away all
relics of superstition, which, still persisting in
the minds of the many, drives them to the faith-curist
and to the quack.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p class="st1">MEDICAL SUPERSTITION AND INSANITY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of medicine is conjoined with the
evolution of theology to an extent which makes
them almost inseparable, and this may best be
seen from a study of the management of the insane,
which is a continuous record of cruelty
based upon medico-theological superstition. Perhaps
the most heartrending chapter of unphilosophical
theology teems with the narration of
thousands of unfortunate beings murdered, tortured,
and mishandled by the finesse in the
interpretation of Biblical texts. The greatest
triumph of modern medicine has consisted in
unfettering the views of effete centuries, born of
superstition and misconception, and in placing
the treatment of the insane upon a humane,
often even a curative, plane. As other afflictions
of humanity were attributed to the agency
of evil spirits, this was particularly the case with
insanity; for if the evil one found it an easy
task to control the corporeal acts of humanity,
his power over the mental functions of the
person afflicted was even greater. Hence, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was not the person who acted, but the evil spirit
in him. Thus, the devil and his minions were
the specific pathogenic agents.</p>

<p>This conception was not universal, for history
shows us that clear thinkers, far in advance of
their times, had an almost correct view of the
nature of insanity—namely, that it was due to
an affection of the mind. Among such men
were Hippocrates, Aretæus, Soranus, Galen,
Aurelianus, etc., and some of the Mohammedan
physicians. These apostles of science taught
that insanity was a disease of the brain, and the
most efficient remedy, mild, palliative treatment.</p>

<p>The belief which had flourished in most of
the Oriental religions from remote antiquity,
that the power of evil demons was the active
cause of disease, particularly that lunacy was
due to diabolic possession, became rooted in the
early Christian Church and flourished for eighteen
centuries, each leaf of this malignant plant
representing countless unfortunates sacrificed to
superstition. Later it was thought that the
moon had a direct influence upon perturbation
of the mind; hence, the term “lunacy” developed.</p>

<p>These doctrines gained special credence in the
first centuries after Christ by the dissemination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
under the Church Fathers of the story of the
miracles which they claimed had been performed
by Jesus of Nazareth. Did not the Savior cast
out devils? Did He not cure madness? The
very word “epilepsy” shows by its derivation,
ἐπίληψις (to seize upon), that possession was
the presumable nature of the malady.</p>

<p>The noble work accomplished by the “pagan”
pioneer alienists was discredited or forgotten,
and the Church originated a process by which
the possessed were to be treated. This method
of treatment was derived purely from theologic
sources, tempered with sufficient dogma. At
first the treatment was gentle, in accordance
with the spirit of the great physicians of antiquity,
and if the afflicted one was not violent he
was permitted to attend public worship. Sacred
salves and holy water, the breath or the spittle
of the officiating priest, the touching of relics, or
a visit to holy places, were the principal therapeutic
agents employed. These methods, even
if they did no good (sometimes merely the consolation
of a kind word from the priest had a
beneficial effect), certainly did no harm, even
tho such practises were factors in the spread of
superstition.</p>

<p>This mild form of treatment did not, however,
long continue. Soon measures were directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
toward driving out the evil spirit from the possessed.
This was attempted in various ways;
first, by exorcism, in the period of Justin Martyr,
and continued up to almost recent times (see
Lecky, “History of European Morals”). “From
the time of Justin Martyr for about two centuries,
there is, I believe, not a single Christian
writer who does not solemnly and explicitly assert
the reality and frequent employment of this
power.”</p>

<p>One of the chief attributes of the devil was
pride, therefore attempts were made by exorcism
to pierce this vulnerable point in the armor of
the evil one, and the foulest, vilest epithets were
used to attain this end. It is impossible to-day
to print these expressions, even in a work of
scientific character, and it is better, perhaps, to
refer such as are especially interested in them to
the <cite>Manuale Benedictionum</cite>, by the Bishop of Passau,
published in 1849, and similar works. Adjuvants
to this form of treatment consisted in
“frightening” the devil by long words, difficult
to pronounce, commonly derived from Oriental
languages, by the administration of malodorous
and filthy “drugs,” and similar practises.</p>

<p>It was claimed that many devils were thus
driven out, and the annals of the Church contain
numerous records of persons cured in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
manner. “The Jesuit Fathers at Vienna, in
1583, glorified in the fact that in such a contest
they had cast out twelve thousand, six hundred
and fifty-two living devils” (White). The
prevalence of these ideas to such a degree in the
minds of the people may be noted from the fact
that, in the churches themselves, such scenes are
carved in stone and depicted on canvas. Medieval
drama teemed with similar conceptions, and
this condition of affairs prevailed for over one
thousand years, unfortunately not in this harmless
manner, but supplemented by great cruelty,
which forms, perhaps, the most terrible chapter
in the history of medical superstition.</p>

<p>The subtleties of theologic interpretation soon
evolved a more comprehensive method of dealing
with the “possessor” and the possessed.
As an appeal to pride was ineffectual and noxious
drugs unavailing, it was found necessary to
whip the devil out, or the unfortunate individuals
were imprisoned, and as a refinement of this
treatment they were even tortured. Thus the
jailer for a long time played the part of a specialist
in lunacy, with the clergy in consultation.
Places in which the insane were confined were
known as “fool towers” and “witch towers.”</p>

<p>This state of things was not altered with the
dawn of the Reformation. The writings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Luther conclusively show his ideas in regard to
possession and witchcraft, and these views under
Calvin reached enormous development. Even
Cotton Mather, in many respects far in advance
of his times, and who himself had known persecution,
was not emancipated from these delusions,
and Salem has many a story to tell of possession
and witch-baiting. It is true we may quite
properly consider these views as the thought of
the times, but, in many other respects, Luther,
Calvin, and Mather were in advance of their
period, and, therefore, a justification for their
actions is not quite apparent. Marcus Aurelius
also was much superior to his age, yet was
grateful to his teachers that they taught him to
disregard superstition in all its various forms.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that conditions of this kind
frequently led to epidemics—if not of actual insanity,
at least to hysteria—which not rarely
developed in cities, nunneries, and monasteries;
thus the epidemics in Erfurt in 1237, in the
Rhine countries in 1374, and many others (see
Hirsch).</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable that while such views
and practises prevailed in the Christian Church,
the followers of Mohammed not only held different
views, but adopted a mode of treatment of
the insane which laid the foundation of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
therapeutics in diseases of the mind. In the
twelfth century, in Bagdad, a palace called the
“Home of Mercy” was built, in which the
insane were confined, examined every month,
and released as soon as they had recovered. An
asylum in Cairo was founded in 1304, while the
first Christian asylum expressly for the mad is
noted in 1409 (Lecky).</p>

<p>But science fought its way through the barriers
of ignorance, misdirected zeal, and superstition.
Altho there were physicians and “magicians,”
who conformed to the views of the Church, the
seed sown by the earlier schools of medicine
slowly but surely began to put forth shoots,
and the result was a tree of knowledge, the fruit
of which may be observed in every modern insane
asylum of the world, where the unfortunate
sufferer is treated with kindness and skill, which,
fortunately, often results in cure.</p>

<p>Scientific reason frequently rebelled against
the “insane superstition,” at first mildly, but
constantly increasing in strength, until an effectual
protest was finally raised by John Weir, of
Cleves, who was soon followed by Michel de Montaigne.
And now a battle royal was waged between
the adherents of theology and the disciples
of the “resurrected” truth, and once more in
the history of the world was demonstrated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
correctness of the saying, that “truth crushed to
earth shall rise again.” All over the world the
warfare was carried, and at the end of the eighteenth
century new champions arose—Jean Baptiste
Pinel in France, and William Tuke in
England. Their followers are legion, and in the
book of life, in letters of gold, many a name has
been written of those who trod in the footsteps
of these pioneers. Theology no longer interferes
in the treatment of the insane; in fact, it would
be manifestly unjust not to mention that many
Christian theologians subsequently joined in the
noble work of lunacy reform, and aided progress
greatly.</p>

<p>How great this progress in the treatment of
the insane can best be appreciated by some of the
older physicians in practise to-day. Who does
not remember the chains, the strait-jacket, the
dark locked cells of the insane asylum? These
conditions existed not very many years ago, and
altho the novels of Charles Reade are no doubt
greatly exaggerated in regard to the conditions
he portrayed in insane asylums, yet <em>more than a
grain of truth</em> is probably contained in them.
The books did much to bring about reforms in
England and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Modern alienists have wrought wonders; their
successful operations are not published in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
daily press, but any visitor who knows what an
insane asylum was fifty years ago, and who spends
a few hours in a modern hospital for the treatment
of lunatics, will observe what appears but
little short of the miraculous. Imagine two thousand
or more insane persons dining in a large
hall, upon the table a tablecloth, and the insane
using knife and fork in a decorous manner, and
when the visitor is told that the “violent ward”
is also present, and is asked to single these out
from among the many, and fails (as he invariably
does), the results attained by science, above
all other measures, are strikingly apparent.</p>
